# Project Section 

The field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is expanding rapidly with the emergence of new techniques and models fuelled by artificial intelligence. 
Within this vast field, machine translation represents a major challenge, especially when dealing with less standardised dialectal languages. 
In this context, our project focuses on the translation of Moroccan Arabic, also known as Darija, into Modern Standard Arabic (MSA), a complex task that presents unique challenges.
The main objective of our work is to develop a system capable of efficiently and accurately translating Darija into MSA using advanced NLP techniques. 
To achieve this goal, we are exploiting the data provided by the Darija Open Dataset (DODa), a collection of 10,000 sentence triplets comprising English, Darija and MSA. 
In addition, we are drawing on the latest advances in pre-trained language models, in particular the OpenAI gpt model and Arabart.
This project raises several challenges, including data augmentation to enrich the initial training set, as well as training a translation model adapted to the linguistic peculiarities of Darija. 
We evaluate the performance of our system using the BLEU score, a standard measure in the evaluation of machine translation systems.
The following sections will detail our approach to data augmentation, the design of the translation model, and our conclusions and prospects for future developments in this exciting area of NLP.
