Introduction</b></h2>\n","<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","Compared to traditional machine learning approaches (e.g., TF-IDF + SVM) that consider words and combinations of them as unique dimensions of the feature space, deep learning models embed words as vectors in a low-dimensional continuous space where dimensions represent shared latent concepts. The main advantages of this approach are (1) the ability to capture the similarity between words and thus to share predictive power between them; and (2) escaping the curse of dimensionality. Word embeddings can be initialized randomly and learned during training, or be pre-trained. In NLP, pre-trained word vectors obtained with word2vec from very large corpora are often used. The pre-trained word vectors can then be updated during training, or be kept static.\n","</p>\n","\n","<h3><b>2. Learning Objective</b></h2>\n","<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","In this lab, you will learn about one of the two word2vec variants: skip-gram with negative sampling. We will derive and implement the model by hand using NumPy, and train it on a subset of the Internet Movie Database (IMDB) <a href='http://ai.stanford.edu/ ̃amaas/data/sentiment/'>dataset</a>.\n","Readings: the original paper introducing skip-gram (along with the other word2vec variant, CBOW) is [<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1301.3781'>Mikolov et al., 2013a</a>]. Negative sampling was proposed in a follow-up paper [<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1310.4546'>Mikolov et al., 2013b</a>]. Helpful resources to understand how skip-gram works are [<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.3722'>Goldberg et Levy, 2014</a>] and subsection 3.1 of [<a href='https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.04606'>Bojanowski et al., 2017</a>].\n","</p>\n","\n","<h3><b>3. Preprocessing</b></h2>\n","<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","Before sampling training examples, the raw data need to be cleaned. Then, each document has to be converted into a list of integers. The integers correspond to indexes in a vocabulary (dictionary) in which the most frequent word has index 1 and only the words that appear a least a certain number of times in the dataset are kept. Index 0 is reserved for out-of-vocabulary words.\n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"NU8DZ-kVPuBX"},"source":["### Importing libraries and downloading the data:"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":1,"metadata":{"id":"6fcO2sbrulEJ","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1707140797582,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":7842,"user":{"displayName":"Ange Gounadon","userId":"05431015772885463032"}},"outputId":"294297f0-5839-4a07-ccf9-ed838294b582"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stderr","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Unzipping corpora/stopwords.zip.\n"]}],"source":["import re\n","import json\n","import operator\n","from bs4 import BeautifulSoup\n","from collections import Counter\n","import json\n","import numpy as np\n","import matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","\n","from tqdm import tqdm\n","from itertools import islice\n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","from nltk.tokenize import TweetTokenizer\n","from sklearn.manifold import TSNE\n","from sklearn.decomposition import PCA\n","from sklearn.metrics.pairwise import cosine_similarity as cosine\n","import nltk\n","nltk.download('stopwords')\n","\n","import warnings\n","import urllib\n","warnings.filterwarnings(\"ignore\")\n","\n","urllib.request.urlretrieve(\"https://onedrive.live.com/download?cid=AE69638675180117&resid=AE69638675180117%2151351&authkey=AHMClMM4ep3hNHw\", 'imdb_reviews.txt')\n","\n","path_read = './'\n","path_write =  './'"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"z_9_vD4yCkGv"},"source":["\n","<b><h4><font color='blue'>\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid blue\"> </hr>\n","Task 1: </b><br>\n","Fill the gaps in the next cellto perform the steps described above.\n","<hr style=\"border:10px solid blue\"> </hr>\n","</font></h4>"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":17,"metadata":{"id":"kaN3aNU_svtv","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1707141897319,"user_tz":-60,"elapsed":34426,"user":{"displayName":"Ange Gounadon","userId":"05431015772885463032"}},"outputId":"be621aa5-9e90-4ec6-e923-cea18ef3781e"},"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["0 / 25000 reviews cleaned\n","5000 / 25000 reviews cleaned\n","10000 / 25000 reviews cleaned\n","15000 / 25000 reviews cleaned\n","20000 / 25000 reviews cleaned\n","counts saved to disk\n","vocab saved to disk\n","0 / 25000 reviews converted to ints\n","5000 / 25000 reviews converted to ints\n","10000 / 25000 reviews converted to ints\n","15000 / 25000 reviews converted to ints\n","20000 / 25000 reviews converted to ints\n","reviews saved to disk\n"]}],"source":["min_freq = 5 #

Objective</b></h2>\n","<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">\n","Skip-gram is then trained to assign high probabilities to the words in $C_t$, given t, i.e., to predict well the context of a given target word. This translates into the following log-likelihood:\n","$$argmax_{θ}\\sum^{T}_{t=0}\\sum_{c∈C_{t}}logp(c|t;\\theta)$$\n","The set of parameters of the model, θ, contains two matrices of word vectors, say $W_t$ and $W_c$, from which are drawn the vectors of the words when they are used as targets and contexts, respectively. If we denote by V the vocabulary (unique words), and by d the dimensionality of the word embedding space, we can assume that $W_t$ and Wc live respectively in $R^{|V|×d}$ and $R^{d×|V|}$. These two matrices are often referred to as input and output matrices, and it is common practice to use the input matrix, after training, as the final word embeddings.<br>\n","<b>Softmax vs. negative sampling</b>: The predictions p(c|t; θ) ∀c ∈ $C_t$ are given by looking at the entries of the vector in $R^{1×|V|}$ obtained by passing the vector $w_t$ ∈ $R^d$ of the target word to a simple linear layer parameterized by $W_c$. That is, by multiplying $w_t$ with matrix $W_c$[This operation is fully linear: no nonlinear activation function is applied (there is no hidden layer). Because of this, skip- gram cannot really be considered to be a deep learning model. The term shallow neural network, or log-linear model, is more appropriate. The same holds for CBOW]. Further, to ensure that legitimate probabilities are obtained, we normalize with a softmax:\n","\n","$$ p(c|t;\\theta)=\\frac{e^{w_c.w_t}}{\\sum_{v∈V}e^{w_v.w_t}}$$\n","However, this approach is expensive because of the large size of the vocabulary V ($10^5$ or $10^6$).\n","<b>Negative sampling trick:</b> learning to discriminate. Rather than trying to assign a probability to each single word in the vocabulary, another approach consists in performing independent discrimination tasks. In this scenario, we teach the model to distinguish between words from the true context $C_{t}^{+}$ of a given target word and negative examples $C_{t}^{-}$, i.e., words that are sampled at random from the vocabulary:\n","$$argmax_{\\theta}∑_{t=1}^{T}(∑_{c ∈C_{t}^{+}}logp(c|t;θ)+∑_{c ∈C_{t}^{-}$}log(1-p(c|t;θ)))$$\n","We now just have independent binary classification tasks to perform.
