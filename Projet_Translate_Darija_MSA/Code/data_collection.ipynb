LITTLE PRINCE', 'Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest', 'It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal', 'Here is a copy of the drawing', 'In the book it said: \"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it', 'After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion', '\" I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle', 'And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing', 'My Drawing Number One', 'It looked like this', 'I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them', 'But they answered: \"Frighten', 'Why should anyone be frightened by a hat', '\" My drawing was not a picture of a hat', 'It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant', 'But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly', 'They always need to have things explained', 'My Drawing Number Two looked like this', \"The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar\", 'That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter', 'I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two', 'Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them', 'So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes', 'I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me', 'At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona', 'If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable', 'In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence', 'I have lived a great deal among grown-ups', 'I have seen them intimately, close at hand', \"And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them\", 'Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept', 'I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding', 'But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: \"That is a hat', '\" Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars', 'I would bring myself down to his level', 'I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties', 'And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man', 'So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago', 'Something was broken in my engine', 'And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone', 'It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week', 'The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation', 'I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean', 'Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice', 'It said: \"If you please, draw me a sheep', '\"\\n\"What', '\"\\n\"Draw me a sheep', '\"\\nI jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck', 'I blinked my eyes hard', 'I looked carefully all around me', 'And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness', 'Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him', 'But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model', 'That, however, is not my fault', \"The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside\", 'Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment', 'Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region', 'And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear', 'Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation', 'When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: \"But, what are you doing here', '\" And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:\\n\"If you please, draw me a sheep', '\"\\nWhen a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey', 'Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen', 'But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw', 'He answered me: \"That doesn\\'t matter', 'Draw me a sheep', '\" But I had never drawn a sheep', 'So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often', 'It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside', 'And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, \"No, no, no', 'I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor', 'A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome', 'Where I live, everything is very small', 'What I need is a sheep', 'Draw me a sheep', 'So then I made a drawing', 'He looked at it carefully, and then he said: \"No', 'This sheep is already very sickly', 'Make me another', '\" So I made another drawing', 'My friend smiled gently and indulgently', '\"You see yourself,\" he said, \"that this is not a sheep', 'This is a ram', 'It has horns', 'So then I did my drawing over once more', 'But it was rejected too, just like the others', '\"This one is too old', 'I want a sheep that will live a long time', 'By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart', 'So I tossed off this drawing', 'And I threw out an explanation with it', '\"This is only his box', 'The sheep you asked for is inside', '\"\\nI was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:\\n\"That is exactly the way I wanted it', 'Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass', '\"\\n\"Why', '\"\\n\"Because where I live everything is very small', '\"\\n\"There will surely be enough grass for him,\" I said', '\"It is a very small sheep that I have given you', '\"\\nHe bent his head over the drawing: \"Not so small that, Look', 'He has gone to sleep', '\"\\xa0\\n\\nAnd that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince', 'It took me a long time to learn where he came from', 'The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him', 'It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me', 'The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), and he asked me: \"What is that object', '\"\\n\"That is not an object', 'It flies', 'It is an airplane', 'It is my airplane', '\" And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly', 'He cried out, then: \"What', 'You dropped down from the sky', '\"\\n\"Yes,\" I answered, modestly', '\"Oh', 'That is funny', '\" And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much', 'I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously', 'Then he added: \"So you, too, come from the sky', 'Which is your planet', '\" At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: \"Do you come from another planet', '\" But he did not reply', 'He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: \"It is true that on that you can\\'t have come from very far away', '\" And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time', 'Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure', 'You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the \"other planets', '\" I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject', '\"My little man, where do you come from', \"What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak\", 'Where do you want to take your sheep', '\"\\nAfter a reflective silence he answered: \"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house', '\"\\n\"That is so', 'And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to', '\"\\nBut the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: \"Tie him', 'What a queer idea', '\"\\n\"But if you don\\'t tie him,\" I said, \"he will wander off somewhere, and get lost', '\"\\nMy friend broke into another peal of laughter: \"But where do you think he would go', '\" \"Anywhere', 'Straight ahead of him', '\"\\nThen the little prince said, earnestly: \"That doesn\\'t matter', 'Where I live, everything is so small', '\" And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: \"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far', '\"\\n\\nI had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house', 'But that did not really surprise me much', 'I knew very well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope', 'When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number', 'He might call it, for example, \"Asteroid 325', '\"\\nI have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612', 'This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope', 'That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909', 'On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration', 'But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said', 'Grown-ups are like that', 'Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume', 'So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance', 'And this time everybody accepted his report', 'If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways', 'When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters', 'They never say to you, \"What does his voice sound like', 'What games does he love best', 'Does he collect butterflies', '\" Instead, they demand: \"How old is he', 'How many brothers has he got', 'How much does he weigh', 'How much money does his father make', '\"\\nOnly from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him', 'If you were to say to the grown-ups: \"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,\" they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all', 'You would have to say to them: \"I saw a house that cost $ 20,000', '\" Then they would exclaim: \"Oh, what a pretty house that is', '\" Just so, you might say to them: \"The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep', 'If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists', '\" And what good would it do to tell them that', 'They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child', 'But if you said to them: \"The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,\" then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions', 'They are like that', 'One must not hold it against them', 'Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people', 'But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference', 'I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales', 'I should have like to say: \"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than him, and who had need of a sheep', '\"\\nTo those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story', 'For I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly', 'I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories', 'Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep', 'If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him', 'To forget a friend is sad', 'Not everyone has had a friend', 'And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures', 'It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils', 'It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six', 'I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible', 'But I am not at all sure of success', 'One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject', \"I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short\", 'And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume', 'So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling', 'In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also', 'But that is something that will not be my fault', 'My friend never explained anything to me', 'He thought, perhaps, that I was like him', 'But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes', 'Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups', 'I have had to grow old', \"As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, and his journey\", 'The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts', 'It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs', 'This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it', 'For the little prince asked me abruptly, as if seized by a grave doubt,\\n\"It is true, isn\\'t it, that sheep eat little bushes', '\"\\n\"Yes, that is true', '\"\\n\"Ah', 'I am glad', '\"\\nI did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes', 'But the little prince added: \"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs', '\" I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab', 'The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh', '\"We would have to put them one on top of the other,\" he said', 'But he made a wise comment:\\n\"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little', '\"\\n\"That is strictly correct,\" I said', '\"But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs', '\"\\nHe answered me at once, \"Oh, come, come', '\", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident', 'And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance', 'Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived, as on all planets, good plants and bad plants', 'In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants', 'But seeds are invisible', \"They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until someone among them is seized with the desire to awaken\", 'Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun', 'If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish', 'But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it', 'Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab', 'The soil of that planet was infested with them', 'A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late', 'It spreads over the entire planet', 'It bores clear through it with its roots', 'And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces', '\"It is a question of discipline,\" the little prince said to me later on', '\"When you\\'ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care', 'You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth', 'It is very tedious work,\" the little prince added, \"but very easy', '\" And one day he said to me: \"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is', 'That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day', 'Sometimes,\" he added, \"there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day', 'But when it is a matter of baobabs, it always means a catastrophe', 'I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man', 'He neglected three little bushes', 'So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet', 'I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist', 'But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve', '\"Children,\" I say plainly, \"watch out for the baobabs', '\" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing', 'The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me', 'Perhaps you will ask me, \"Why are there no other drawings in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs', '\" The reply is simple', 'I have tried', 'But with the others I have not been successful', 'When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity', 'Oh, little prince', 'Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life', 'For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset', 'I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:\\n\"I am very fond of sunsets', 'Come, let us go look at a sunset now', '\"\\n\"But we must wait,\" I said', '\"Wait', 'What for', '\"\\n\"For the sunset', 'We must wait until it is time', '\"\\nAt first you seemed to be very much surprised', 'And then you laughed to yourself', 'You said to me: \"I am always thinking that I am at home', '\"\\nJust so', 'Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France', 'If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon', 'Unfortunately, France is too far away for that', 'But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps', 'You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like', '\"One day,\" you said to me, \"I saw the sunset forty-four times', '\"\\nAnd a little later you added: \"You know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad', '\" \"Were you so sad, then', '\" I asked, \"On the day of the forty-four sunsets', '\"\\nBut the little prince made no reply', \"On the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me\", 'Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded: \"A sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too', '\"\\n\"A sheep,\" I answered, \"eats anything it finds in its reach', '\"\\n\"Even flowers that have thorns', '\"\\n\"Yes, even flowers that have thorns', '\"\\n\"Then the thorns, what use are they', '\" I did not know', 'At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine', 'I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious', 'And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst', '\"The thorns, what use are they', '\"\\nThe little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it', 'As for me, I was upset over that bolt', 'And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: \"The thorns are of no use at all', 'Flowers have thorns just for spite', '\"\\n\"Oh', '\" There was a moment of complete silence', 'Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: \"I don\\'t believe you', 'Flowers are weak creatures', 'They are naïve', 'They reassure themselves as best they can', 'They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons', '\"\\nI did not answer', 'At that instant I was saying to myself: \"If this bolt still won\\'t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer', '\"\\nAgain the little prince disturbed my thoughts', '\"And you actually believe that the flowers', '\"\\n\"Oh no', '\" I cried', '\"No no no', \"I don't believe anything\", 'I answered you with the first thing that came into my head', \"Don't you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence\", '\"\\nHe stared at me, thunderstruck', '\"Matters of consequence', '\"\\nHe looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly', '\"You talk just like the grown-ups', '\" That made me a little ashamed', 'But he went on, relentlessly: \"You mix everything up together', 'You confuse everything', '\"\\nHe was really very angry', 'He tossed his golden curls in the breeze', '\"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman', 'He has never smelled a flower', 'He has never looked at a star', 'He has never loved any one', 'He has never done anything in his life but add up figures', \"And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence\", \"' And that makes him swell up with pride\", '\"But he is not a man, he is a mushroom', '\"\\n\"A what', '\"\\n\"A mushroom', '\" The little prince was now white with rage', '\"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years', 'For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same', 'And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them', 'Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important', \"Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums\", 'And if I know, I, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing, Oh', 'You think that is not important', '\"\\nHis face turned from white to red as he continued: \"If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars', \"\\x94\\nHe can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there\", \"' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened\", 'And you think that is not important', '\"\\nHe could not say anything more', 'His words were choked by sobbing', 'The night had fallen', 'I had let my tools drop from my hands', 'Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death', 'On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted', 'I took him in my arms, and rocked him', 'I said to him: \"The flower that you love is not in danger', 'I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep', 'I will draw you a railing to put around your flower', 'I will', '\"\\nI did not know what to say to him', 'I felt awkward and blundering', 'I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more', 'It is such a secret place, the land of tears', 'I soon learned to know this flower better', \"On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple\", 'They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody', 'One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away', 'But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet', 'It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab', 'The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower', 'The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it', 'But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber', 'She chose her colours with the greatest care', 'She adjusted her petals one by one', 'She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies', 'It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear', 'Oh, yes', 'She was a coquettish creature', 'And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days', 'Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself', 'And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: \"Ah', 'I am scarcely awake', 'I beg that you will excuse me', 'My petals are still all disarranged', '\" But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:\\n\"Oh', 'How beautiful you are', '\"\\n\"Am I not', '\" the flower responded, sweetly', '\"And I was born at the same moment as the sun', '\"\\nThe little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and exciting she was', '\"I think it is time for breakfast,\" she added an instant later', '\"If you would have the kindness to think of my needs\" And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water', 'So, he tended the flower', 'So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with', 'One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: \"Let the tigers come with their claws', '\"\\n\"There are no tigers on my planet,\" the little prince objected', '\"And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds', '\"\\n\"I am not a weed,\" the flower replied, sweetly', '\"Please excuse me', '\" \"I am not at all afraid of tigers,\" she went on, \"but I am afraid of drafts', 'I suppose you wouldn\\'t have a screen for me\"\\n\"Afraid of drafts, that is bad luck for a plant,\" remarked the little prince, and added to himself, \"This flower is a very complex creature', '\"\\n\"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe', 'It is very cold where you live', 'In the place I came from', '\" But she interrupted herself at that point', 'She had come in the form of a seed', 'She could not have known anything of any other worlds', 'Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong', '\"The screen', '\"\\n\"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me', '\"\\nThen she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same', 'So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her', 'He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy', '\"I ought not to have listened to her,\" he confided to me one day', '\"One never ought to listen to the flowers', 'One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance', 'Mine perfumed my entire planet', 'But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace', 'This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity', '\"\\nAnd he continued his confidences: \"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything', 'I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words', 'She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me', 'I ought never to have run away from her', 'I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems', 'Flowers are so inconsistent', 'But I was too young to know how to love her', '\"\\n\\nI believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds', 'On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order', 'He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes', 'He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning', 'He also had one volcano that was extinct', 'But, as he said, \"One never knows', '\" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too', 'If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions', 'Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney', 'On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes', 'That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us', 'The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs', 'He believed that he would never want to return', 'But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him', 'And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears', '\"Goodbye,\" he said to the flower', 'But she made no answer', '\"Goodbye,\" he said again', 'The flower coughed', 'But it was not because she had a cold', '\"I have been silly,\" she said to him, at last', '\"I ask your forgiveness', 'Try to be happy', '\" He was surprised by this absence of reproaches', 'He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air', 'He did not understand this quiet sweetness', '\"Of course I love you,\" the flower said to him', '\"It is my fault that you have not known it all the while', 'That is of no importance', 'But you, you have been just as foolish as I', 'Try to be happy', 'let the glass globe be', \"I don't want it anymore\", '\"\\n\"But the wind', '\" \"My cold is not so bad as all that', 'the cool night air will do me good', 'I am a flower', '\"\\n\"But the animals', '\" \"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies', 'It seems that they are very beautiful', 'And if not the butterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me', 'You will be far away', 'as for the large animals, I am not at all afraid of any of them', 'I have my claws', '\"\\nAnd, naively, she showed her four thorns', 'Then she added: \"Don\\'t linger like this', 'You have decided to go away', 'Now go', '\"\\nFor she did not want him to see her crying', 'She was such a proud flower', 'He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330', 'He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge', 'The first of them was inhabited by a king', 'Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic', '\"Ah', 'Here is a subject,\" exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming', 'And the little prince asked himself: \"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before', '\"\\nHe did not know how the world is simplified for kings', 'To them, all men are subjects', '\"Approach, so that I may see you better,\" said the king, who felt proud of being at last a king over somebody', \"The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe\", 'So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned', '\"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,\" the monarch said to him', '\"I forbid you to do so', '\"\\n\"I can\\'t help it', 'I can\\'t stop myself,\" replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed', '\"I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep', '\"\\n\"Ah, then,\" the king said', '\"I order you to yawn', 'It is years since I have seen anyone yawning', 'Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity', 'Come, now', 'Yawn again', 'It is an order', '\"\\n\"That frightens me', 'I cannot, anymore', '\" murmured the little prince, now completely abashed', '\"Hum', 'Hum', '\" replied the king', '\"Then I', 'I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes too\" He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed', 'For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected', 'He tolerated no disobedience', 'He was an absolute monarch', 'But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable', '\"If I ordered a general,\" he would say, by way of example, \"if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me that would not be the fault of the general', 'It would be my fault', '\"\\n\"May I sit down', '\" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince', '\"I order you to do so,\" the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle', 'But the little prince was wondering', 'The planet was tiny', 'Over what could this king really rule', '\"Sire,\" he said to him, \"I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question\"\\n\"I order you to ask me a question,\" the king hastened to assure him', '\"Sire, over what do you rule', '\" \"Over everything,\" said the king, with magnificent simplicity', '\"Over everything', '\" The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars', '\"Over all that', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Over all that,\" the king answered', 'For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal', '\"And the stars obey you', '\" \"Certainly they do,\" the king said', '\"They obey instantly', 'I do not permit insubordination', '\"\\nSuch power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at', 'If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair', 'And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:\\n\"I should like to see a sunset', 'do me that kindness', 'Order the sun to set', '\"\\n\"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong', '\" the king demanded', '\"The general or myself', '\"\\n\"You,\" said the little prince firmly', '\"Exactly', 'One much requires from each one the duty which each one can perform,\" the king went on', '\"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason', 'If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution', 'I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable', '\"\\n\"Then my sunset', '\" the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it', '\"You shall have your sunset', 'I shall command it', 'But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable', '\"\\n\"When will that be', '\" inquired the little prince', '\"Hum', 'Hum', '\" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac', '\"Hum', 'Hum', 'That will be about', 'about', 'that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight', 'And you will see how well I am obeyed', '\"\\nThe little prince yawned', 'He was regretting his lost sunset', 'And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored', '\"I have nothing more to do here,\" he said to the king', '\"So I shall set out on my way again', '\" \"Do not go,\" said the king, who was very proud of having a subject', '\"Do not go', 'I will make you a Minister', '\" \"Minister of what', '\" \"Minster of', 'of Justice', '\" \"But there is nobody here to judge', '\" \"We do not know that,\" the king said to him', '\"I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom', 'I am very old', 'There is no room here for a carriage', 'And it tires me to walk', '\" \"Oh, but I have looked already', '\" said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet', 'On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all', '\"Then you shall judge yourself,\" the king answered', '\"That is the most difficult thing of all', 'It is much more difficult to judge yourself than to judge others', 'If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom', '\"\\n\"Yes,\" said the little prince, \"but I can judge myself anywhere', 'I do not need to live on this planet', '\"Hum', 'Hum', '\" said the king', '\"I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat', 'I hear him at night', 'You can judge this old rat', 'From time to time you will condemn him to death', 'Thus his life will depend on your justice', 'But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily', 'He is the only one we have', '\"\\n\"I,\" replied the little prince, \"do not like to condemn anyone to death', 'And now I think I will go on my way', '\" \"No,\" said the king', 'But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch', '\"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,\" he said, \"he should be able to give me a reasonable order', 'He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute', 'It seems to me that conditions are favorable', '\" As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment', 'Then, with a sigh, he took his leave', '\"I made you my Ambassador,\" the king called out, hastily', 'He had a magnificent air of authority', '\"The grown-ups are very strange,\" the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey', 'The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man', '\"Ah', 'Ah', 'I am about to receive a visit from an admirer', '\" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming', 'For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"That is a queer hat you are wearing', '\"\\n\"It is a hat for salutes,\" the conceited man replied', '\"It is to rise in salute when people acclaim me', 'Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way', '\"\\n\"Yes', '\" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about', '\"Clap your hands, one against the other,\" the conceited man now directed him', 'The little prince clapped his hands', 'The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute', '\"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,\" the little prince said to himself', 'And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other', 'The conceited man against raised his hat in salute', \"After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony\", '\"And what should one do to make the hat come down', '\" he asked', 'But the conceited man did not hear him', 'Conceited people never hear anything but praise', '\"Do you really admire me very much', '\" he demanded of the little prince', '\"What does that mean, \\'admire\\'', '\"\\n\"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet', '\" \"But you are the only man on your planet', '\" \"Do me this kindness', 'Admire me just the same', '\"\\n\"I admire you,\" said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, \"but what is there in that to interest you so much', '\"\\nAnd the little prince went away', '\"The grown-ups are certainly very odd,\" he said to himself, as he continued on his journey', 'The next planet was inhabited by a tippler', 'This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection', '\"What are you doing there', '\" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles', '\"I am drinking,\" replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air', '\"Why are you drinking', '\" demanded the little prince', '\"So that I may forget,\" replied the tippler', '\"Forget what', '\" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him', '\"Forget that I am ashamed,\" the tippler confessed, hanging his head', '\"Ashamed of what', '\" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him', '\"Ashamed of drinking', '\" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence', 'And the little prince went away, puzzled', '\"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\" he said to himself, as he continued on his journey', 'The fourth planet belonged to a businessman', \"This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival\", '\"Good morning,\" the little prince said to him', '\"Your cigarette has gone out', '\"\\n\"Three and two make five', 'Five and seven make twelve', 'Twelve and three make fifteen', 'Good morning', 'Fifteen and seven make twenty-two', 'Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight', \"I haven't time to light it again\", 'Twenty-six and five make thirty-one', 'Phew', 'Then that makes five-hundred-and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, and seven-hundred-thirty-one', '\"\\n\"Five hundred million what', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Eh', 'Are you still there', \"Five-hundred-and-one million, I can't stop\", 'I have so much to do', 'I am concerned with matters of consequence', \"I don't amuse myself with balderdash\", 'Two and five make seven', '\"\\n\"Five-hundred-and-one million what', '\" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it', 'The businessman raised his head', '\"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times', 'The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where', 'He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition', 'The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism', \"I don't get enough exercise\", 'I have no time for loafing', 'The third time, well, this is it', 'I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions\"\\n\"Millions of what', '\" The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question', '\"Millions of those little objects,\" he said, \"which one sometimes sees in the sky', '\" \"Flies', '\" \"Oh, no',

'\"\\n\"And what good does it do you to own the stars', '\" \"It does me the good of making me rich', '\"\\n\"And what good does it do you to be rich', '\"\\n\"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered', '\"\\n\"This man,\" the little prince said to himself, \"reasons a little like my poor tippler', '\" Nevertheless, he still had some more questions', '\"How is it possible for one to own the stars', '\" \"To whom do they belong', '\" the businessman retorted, peevishly', '\"I don\\'t know', 'To nobody', '\" \"Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it', '\" \"Is that all that is necessary', '\" \"Certainly', 'When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours', 'When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours', 'When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours', 'So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them', '\"\\n\"Yes, that is true,\" said the little prince', '\"And what do you do with them', '\"\\n\"I administer them,\" replied the businessman', '\"I count them and recount them', 'It is difficult', 'But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence', '\"\\nThe little prince was still not satisfied', '\"If I owned a silk scarf,\" he said, \"I could put it around my neck and take it away with me', 'If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me', 'But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven', '\"\\n\"No', 'But I can put them in the bank', '\" \"Whatever does that mean', '\" \"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper', 'And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key', '\"\\n\"And that is all', '\"\\n\"That is enough,\" said the businessman', '\"It is entertaining,\" thought the little prince', '\"It is rather poetic', 'But it is of no great consequence', '\" On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups', '\"I myself own a flower,\" he continued his conversation with the businessman, \"which I water every day', 'I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows)', 'It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them', 'But you are of no use to the stars', '\"\\nThe businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer', 'And the little prince went away', '\"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,\" he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey', 'The fifth planet was very strange', 'It was the smallest of all', 'There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter', 'The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house', 'But he said to himself, nevertheless: \"It may well be that this man is absurd', 'But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler', 'For at least his work has some meaning', 'When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower', 'When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep', 'That is a beautiful occupation', 'And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful', '\"\\nWhen he arrived in the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter', '\"Good morning', 'Why have you just put out your lamp', '\"\\n\"Those are the orders,\" replied the lamplighter', '\"Good morning', '\"\\n\"What are the orders', '\"\\n\"The orders are that I put out my lamp', 'Good evening', '\" And he lighted his lamp again', '\"But why have you just lighted it again', '\"\\n\"Those are the orders,\" replied the lamplighter', '\"I do not understand,\" said the little prince', '\"There is nothing to understand,\" said the lamplighter', '\"Orders are orders', 'Good morning', '\" And he put out his lamp', 'Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares', '\"I follow a terrible profession', 'In the old days it was reasonable', 'I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again', 'I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep', '\"\\n\"And the orders have been changed since that time', '\"\\n\"The orders have not been changed,\" said the lamplighter', '\"That is the tragedy', 'From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed', '\"\\n\"Then what', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Then the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose', 'Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out', '\"\\n\"That is very funny', 'A day lasts only one minute, here where you live', '\"\\n\"It is not funny at all', '\" said the lamplighter', '\"While we have been talking together a month has gone by', '\"\\n\"A month', '\"\\n\"Yes, a month', 'Thirty minutes', 'Thirty days', 'Good evening', '\" And he lighted his lamp again', 'As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders', 'He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend', '\"You know,\" he said, \"I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to', '\"\\n\"I always want to rest,\" said the lamplighter', 'For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time', 'The little prince went on with his explanation: \"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it', 'To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly', 'When you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like', '\"\\n\"That doesn\\'t do me much good,\" said the lamplighter', '\"The one thing I love in life is to sleep', '\"\\n\"Then you\\'re unlucky,\" said the little prince', '\"I am unlucky,\" said the lamplighter', '\"Good morning', '\" And he put out his lamp', '\"That man,\" said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, \"that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman', 'Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous', 'Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself', '\"\\nHe breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: \"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend', 'But his planet is indeed too small', 'There is no room on it for two people', '\" What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets', 'The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one', 'It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books', '\"Oh, look', 'Here is an explorer', '\" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming', 'The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little', 'He had already traveled so much and so far', '\"Where do you come from', '\" the old gentleman said to him', '\"What is that big book', '\" said the little prince', '\"What are you doing', '\"\\n\"I am a geographer,\" the old gentleman said to him', '\"What is a geographer', '\" asked the little prince', '\"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts', '\"\\n\"That is very interesting,\" said the little prince', '\"Here at last is a man who has a real profession', '\" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer', 'It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen', '\"Your planet is very beautiful,\" he said', '\"Has it any oceans', '\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t tell you,\" said the geographer', '\"Ah', '\" The little prince was disappointed', '\"Has it any mountains', '\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t tell you,\" said the geographer', '\"And towns, and rivers, and deserts', '\"\\n\"I couldn\\'t tell you that, either', '\"\\n\"But you are a geographer', '\"\\n\"Exactly,\" the geographer said', '\"But I am not an explorer', \"I haven't a single explorer on my planet\", 'It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts', 'The geographer is much too important to go loafing about', 'He does not leave his desk', 'But he receives the explorers in his study', 'He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels', \"And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character\", '\"\\n\"Why is that', '\"\\n\"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer', 'So would do an explorer who drank too much', '\"\\n\"Why is that', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Because intoxicated men see double', 'Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one', '\"\\n\"I know someone,\" said the little prince, \"who would make a bad explorer', '\"\\n\"That is possible', 'Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery', '\"\\n\"One goes to see it', '\"\\n\"No', 'That would be too complicated', 'But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs', 'For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it', '\" The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement', '\"But you you come from far away', 'You are an explorer', 'You shall describe your planet to me', '\" And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil', 'The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil', 'One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink', '\"Well', '\" said the geographer expectantly', '\"Oh, where I live,\" said the little prince, \"it is not very interesting', 'It is all so small', 'I have three volcanoes', 'Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct', 'But one never knows', '\"\\n\"One never knows,\" said the geographer', '\"I have also a flower', '\"\\n\"We do not record flowers,\" said the geographer', '\"Why is that', 'The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet', '\"\\n\"We do not record them,\" said the geographer, \"because they are ephemeral', '\"\\n\"What does that mean \\'ephemeral\\'', '\"\\n\"Geographies,\" said the geographer, \"are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence', 'They never become old-fashioned', 'It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position', 'It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters', 'We write of eternal things', '\"\\n\"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\" the little prince interrupted', '\"What does that mean \\'ephemeral\\'', '\"\\n\"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\" said the geographer', '\"The thing that matters to us is the mountain', 'It does not change', '\"\\n\"But what does that mean \\'ephemeral\\'', '\" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it', '\"It means, \\'which is in danger of speedy disappearance', '\\' \"\\n\"Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance', '\"\\n\"Certainly it is', '\"\\n\"My flower is ephemeral,\" the little prince said to himself, \"and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world', 'And I have left her on my planet, all alone', '\"\\nThat was his first moment of regret', 'But he took courage once more', '\"What place would you advise me to visit now', '\" he asked', '\"The planet Earth,\" replied the geographer', '\"It has a good reputation', '\" And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower', 'So then the seventh planet was the Earth', 'The Earth is not just an ordinary planet', 'One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups', 'To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps', 'Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle', 'The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera', 'First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia', 'Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep', 'Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings', 'After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of North America', 'And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage', 'It would be magnificent', 'Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year', 'When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth', 'I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters', 'And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it', 'Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth', 'If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide', 'All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet', 'The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that', 'They imagine that they fill a great deal of space', 'They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs', 'You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations', 'They adore figures, and that will please them', 'But do not waste your time on this extra task', 'It is unnecessary', 'You have, I know, confidence in me', 'When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people', 'He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand', '\"Good evening,\" said the little prince courteously', '\"Good evening,\" said the snake', '\"What planet is this on which I have come down', '\" asked the little prince', '\"This is the Earth; this is Africa,\" the snake answered', '\"Ah', 'Then there are no people on the Earth', '\"\\n\"This is the desert', 'There are no people in the desert', 'The Earth is large,\" said the snake', 'The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky', '\"I wonder,\" he said, \"whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again', 'Look at my planet', 'It is right there above us', 'But how far away it is', '\"\\n\"It is beautiful,\" the snake said', '\"What has brought you here', '\"\\n\"I have been having some trouble with a flower,\" said the little prince', '\"Ah', '\" said the snake', 'And they were both silent', '\"Where are the men', '\" the little prince at last took up the conversation again', '\"It is a little lonely in the desert', '\"\\n\"It is also lonely among men,\" the snake said', 'The little prince gazed at him for a long time', '\"You are a funny animal,\" he said at last', '\"You are no thicker than a finger', '\"\\n\"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,\" said the snake', 'The little prince smiled', '\"You are not very powerful', \"You haven't even any feet\", 'You cannot even travel', '\"\\n\"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,\" said the snake', \"He twined himself around the little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet\", '\"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,\" the snake spoke again', '\"But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star', '\"\\nThe little prince made no reply', '\"You move me to pity, you are so weak on this Earth made of granite,\" the snake said', '\"I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet', 'I can', '\"\\n\"Oh', 'I understand you very well,\" said the little prince', '\"But why do you always speak in riddles', '\"\\n\"I solve them all,\" said the snake', 'And they were both silent', 'The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower', 'It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"Good morning,\" said the flower', '\"Where are the men', '\" the little prince asked, politely', 'The flower had once seen a caravan passing', '\"Men', '\" she echoed', '\"I think there are six or seven of them in existence', 'I saw them, several years ago', 'But one never knows where to find them', 'The wind blows them away', 'They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult', '\"\\n\"Goodbye,\" said the little prince', '\"Goodbye,\" said the flower', 'After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain', 'The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees', 'And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool', '\"From a mountain as high as this one,\" he said to himself, \"I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people', '\" But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles', '\"Good morning,\" he said courteously', '\"Good morning', 'Good morning', 'Good morning,\" answered the echo', '\"Who are you', '\" said the little prince', '\"Who are you', 'Who are you', 'Who are you', '\" answered the echo', '\"Be my friends', 'I am all alone,\" he said', '\"I am all alone', 'all alone', 'all alone,\" answered the echo', '\"What a queer planet', '\" he thought', '\"It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding', 'And the people have no imagination', 'They repeat whatever one says to them', 'On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak', '\"\\n\\nBut it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road', 'And all roads lead to the abodes of men', '\"Good morning,\" he said', 'He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses', '\"Good morning,\" said the roses', 'The little prince gazed at them', 'They all looked like his flower', '\"Who are you', '\" he demanded, thunderstruck', '\"We are roses,\" the roses said', 'And he was overcome with sadness', 'His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the entire universe', 'And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden', '\"She would be very much annoyed,\" he said to himself, \"if she should see that', 'she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at', 'And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die', '\"\\nThen he went on with his reflections: \"I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in the entire world; and all I had was a common rose', 'A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees-- and one of them perhaps extinct forever', \"that doesn't make me a very great prince\", '\" And he lay down in the grass and cried', 'It was then that the fox appeared', '\"Good morning,\" said the fox', '\"Good morning,\" the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing', '\"I am right here,\" the voice said, \"under the apple tree', '\" \"\\nWho are you', '\" asked the little prince, and added, \"You are very pretty to look at', '\"\\n\"I am a fox,\" said the fox', '\"Come and play with me,\" proposed the little prince', '\"I am so unhappy', '\" \"I cannot play with you,\" the fox said', '\"I am not tamed', '\"\\n\"Ah', 'Please excuse me,\" said the little prince', 'But, after some thought, he added: \"What does that mean, \\'tame\\'', '\"\\n\"You do not live here,\" said the fox', '\"What is it that you are looking for', '\"\\n\"I am looking for men,\" said the little prince', '\"What does that mean, \\'tame\\'', '\"\\n\"Men,\" said the fox', '\"They have guns, and they hunt', 'It is very disturbing', 'They also raise chickens', 'These are their only interests', 'Are you looking for chickens', '\"\\n\"No,\" said the little prince', '\"I am looking for friends', \"What does that mean, 'tame'\", '\"\\n\"It is an act too often neglected,\" said the fox', 'It means to establish ties', '\"\\n\"To establish ties', '\"\\n\"Just that,\" said the fox', '\"To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys', 'And I have no need of you', 'And you, on your part, have no need of me', 'To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes', 'But if you tame me, then we shall need each other', 'To me, you will be unique in the entire world', 'To you, I shall be unique in the entire world', '\"\\n\"I am beginning to understand,\" said the little prince', '\"There is a flower', 'I think that she has tamed me', '\"\\n\"It is possible,\" said the fox', '\"On the Earth one sees all sorts of things', '\"\\n\"Oh, but this is not on the Earth', '\" said the little prince', 'The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious', '\"On another planet', '\"\\n\"Yes', '\"\\n\"Are there hunters on this planet', '\"\\n\"No', '\"\\n\"Ah, that is interesting', 'Are there chickens', '\"\\n\"No', '\"\\n\"Nothing is perfect,\" sighed the fox', 'But he came back to his idea', '\"My life is very monotonous,\" the fox said', '\"I hunt chickens; men hunt me', 'All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike', 'And, in consequence, I am a little bored', 'But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life', 'I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others', 'Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground', 'Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow', 'And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder', 'I do not eat bread', 'Wheat is of no use to me', 'The wheat fields have nothing to say to me', 'And that is sad', 'But you have hair that is the colour of gold', 'Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me', 'The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you', 'And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat', '\" The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time', '\"Please, tame me', '\" he said', '\"I want to, very much,\" the little prince replied', '\"But I have not much time', 'I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand', '\"\\n\"One only understands the things that one tames,\" said the fox', '\"Men have no more time to understand anything', 'They buy things all ready-made at the shops', 'But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more', 'If you want a friend, tame me', '\"\\n\"What must I do, to tame you', '\" asked the little prince', '\"You must be very patient,\" replied the fox', '\"First you will sit down at a little distance from me, like that, in the grass', 'I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing', 'Words are the source of misunderstandings', 'But you will sit a little closer to me, every day', '\"\\nThe next day the little prince came back', '\"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\" said the fox', '\"If, for example, you come at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, then at three o\\'clock I shall begin to be happy', 'I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances', \"At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about\", 'I shall show you how happy I am', 'But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you', 'One must observe the proper rites', '\"\\n\"What is a rite', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Those also are actions too often neglected,\" said the fox', '\"They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours', 'There is a rite, for example, among my hunters', 'Every Thursday they dance with the village girls', 'So Thursday is a wonderful day for me', 'I can take a walk as far as the vineyards', 'But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all', '\"\\nSo the little prince tamed the fox', 'And when the hour of his departure drew near', '\"Ah,\" said the fox, \"I shall cry', '\"\\n\"It is your own fault,\" said the little prince', '\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you', '\"\\n\"Yes, that is so,\" said the fox', '\"But now you are going to cry', '\" said the little prince', '\"Yes, that is so,\" said the fox', '\"Then it has done you no good at all', '\"\\n\"It has done me good,\" said the fox, \"because of the color of the wheat fields', '\" And then he added: \"Go and look again at the roses', 'You will understand now that yours is unique in the entire world', 'Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret', '\"\\nThe little prince went away, to look again at the roses', '\"You are not at all like my rose,\" he said', '\"As yet you are nothing', 'No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one', 'You are like my fox when I first knew him', 'He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes', 'But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in the entire world', '\" And the roses were very much embarrassed', '\"You are beautiful, but you are empty,\" he went on', '\"One could not die for you', 'To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me', 'But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of your other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing', 'Because she is my rose', 'And he went back to meet the fox', '\"Goodbye,\" he said', '\"Goodbye,\" said the fox', '\"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye', '\"\\n\"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember', '\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important', '\"\\n\"It is the time I have wasted for my rose', '\" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember', '\"Men have forgotten this truth,\" said the fox', '\"But you must not forget it', 'You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed', 'You are responsible for your rose', '\"\\n\"I am responsible for my rose,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"Good morning,\" said the railway switchman', '\"What do you do here', '\" the little prince asked', '\"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,\" said the switchman', '\"I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left', '\" And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman\\'s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder', '\"They are in a great hurry,\" said the little prince', '\"What are they looking for', '\"\\n\"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,\" said the switchman', 'And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction', '\"Are they coming back already', '\" demanded the little prince', '\"These are not the same ones,\" said the switchman', '\"It is an exchange', '\"\\n\"Were they not satisfied where they were', '\" asked the little prince', '\"No one is ever satisfied where he is,\" said the switchman', 'And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express', '\"Are they pursuing the first travelers', '\" demanded the little prince', '\"They are pursuing nothing at all,\" said the switchman', '\"They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning', 'Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes', '\"\\n\"Only the children know what they are looking for,\" said the little prince', '\"They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry', '\" \"They are lucky,\" the switchman said', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"Good morning,\" said the merchant', 'This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst', 'You need only swallow one pill a week and you would feel no need of anything to drink', '\"Why are you selling those', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Because they save a tremendous amount of time,\" said the merchant', '\"Computations have been made by experts', 'With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week', '\"\\n\"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes', '\"\\n\"Anything you like', '\"\\n\"As for me,\" said the little prince to himself, \"if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water', '\"\\n\\n\\nIt was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drops of my water supply', '\"Ah,\" I said to the little prince, \"these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water', '\"\\n\"My friend the fox', '\" the little prince said to me', '\"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox', '\"\\n\"Why not', '\"\\n\"Because I am about to die of thirst', '\"\\nHe did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: \"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die', 'I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend', '\"\\n\"He has no way of guessing the danger,\" I said to myself', '\"He has never been either hungry or thirsty', 'A little sunshine is all he needs', '\"\\nBut he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: \"I am thirsty, too', 'Let us look for a well', '\" I made a gesture of weariness', 'It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert', 'But nevertheless we started walking', 'When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out', 'Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream', 'The little prince\\'s last words came reeling back into my memory: \"Then you are thirsty, too', '\" I demanded', 'But he did not reply to my question', 'He merely said to me: \"Water may also be good for the heart', '\"\\nI did not understand this answer, but I said nothing', 'I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him', 'He was tired', 'He sat down', 'I sat down beside him', 'And, after a little silence, he spoke again: \"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen', '\"\\nI replied, \"Yes, that is so', '\" And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight', '\"The desert is beautiful,\" the little prince added', 'And that was true', 'I have always loved the desert', 'One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing', 'Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams', '\"What makes the desert beautiful,\" said the little prince, \"is that somewhere it hides a well', '\"\\nI was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands', 'When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there', 'To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it', 'But it cast an enchantment over that house', 'My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart', '\"Yes,\" I said to the little prince', '\"The house, the stars, the desert-- what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible', '\"\\n\"I am glad,\" he said, \"that you agree with my fox', '\" As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more', 'I felt deeply moved, and stirred', 'It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure', 'It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth', 'In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:\\n\"What I see here is nothing but a shell', 'What is most important is invisible', '\"\\nAs his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep', '\"\\nAnd I felt him to be more fragile still', 'I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind', 'And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak', '\"Men,\" said the little prince, \"set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for', 'Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round', '\" And he added: \"It is not worth the trouble', '\"\\nThe well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara', 'The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand', 'This one was like a well in a village', 'But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming', '\"It is strange,\" I said to the little prince', '\"Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope', '\" He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working', 'And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten', '\"Do you hear', '\" said the little prince', '\"We have wakened the well, and it is singing', '\"\\nI did not want him to tire himself with the rope', '\"Leave it to me,\" I said', '\"It is too heavy for you', '\" I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement', 'The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water', '\"I am thirsty for this water,\" said the little prince', '\"Give me some of it to drink', '\"\\nAnd I understood what he had been looking for', 'I raised the bucket to his lips', 'He drank, his eyes closed', 'It was as sweet as some special festival treat', 'This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment', 'Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms', 'It was good for the heart, like a present', 'When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received', '\"The men where you live,\" said the little prince, \"raise five thousand roses in the same garden and they do not find in it what they are looking for', '\"\\n\"They do not find it,\" I replied', '\"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water', '\"\\n\"Yes, that is true,\" I said', 'And the little prince added: \"But the eyes are blind', 'One must look with the heart', '\"\\nI had drunk the water', 'I breathed easily', 'At sunrise the sand is the color of honey', 'And that honey color was making me happy, too', 'What brought me, then, this sense of grief', '\"You must keep your promise,\" said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more', '\"What promise', '\" \"You know, a muzzle for my sheep', 'I am responsible for this flower', '\"\\nI took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket', 'The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:\\n\"Your baobabs, they look a little like cabbages', '\"\\n\"Oh', '\" I had been so proud of my baobabs', '\"Your fox, his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long', '\" And he laughed again', '\"You are not fair, little prince,\" I said', '\"I don\\'t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside', '\"\\n\"Oh, that will be all right,\" he said, \"children understand', '\"\\nSo then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle', 'And as I gave it to him my heart was torn', '\"You have plans that I do not know about,\" I said', 'But he did not answer me', 'He said to me, instead: \"You know, my descent to the earth', 'Tomorrow will be its anniversary', '\" Then, after a silence, he went on: \"I came down very near here', '\" And he flushed', 'And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow', 'One question, however, occurred to me: \"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you-- a week ago-- you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region', 'You were on the your way back to the place where you landed', '\"\\nThe little prince flushed again', 'And I added, with some hesitancy: \"Perhaps it was because of the anniversary', '\" The little prince flushed once more', 'He never answered questions, but when one flushes does that not mean \"Yes\"', '\"Ah,\" I said to him, \"I am a little frightened', '\"\\nBut he interrupted me', '\"Now you must work', 'You must return to your engine', 'I will be waiting for you here', 'Come back tomorrow evening', '\"\\nBut I was not reassured', 'I remembered the fox', 'One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed', 'Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall', 'When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling', 'And I heard him say: \"Then you don\\'t remember', 'This is not the exact spot', '\" Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: \"Yes, yes', 'It is the right day, but this is not the place', '\"\\nI continued my walk toward the wall', 'At no time did I see or hear anyone', 'The little prince, however, replied once again: \"', 'Exactly', 'You will see where my track begins, in the sand', 'You have nothing to do but wait for me there', 'I shall be there tonight', '\"\\nI was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing', 'After a silence the little prince spoke again: \"You have good poison', 'You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long', '\" I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand', '\"Now go away,\" said the little prince', '\"I want to get down from the wall', '\"\\nI dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall', 'and I leaped into the air', 'There before me, facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end', 'Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back', 'But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones', 'I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow', '\"What does this mean', '\" I demanded', '\"Why are you talking with snakes', '\"\\nI had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore', 'I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink', 'And now I did not dare ask him any more questions', 'He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck', \"I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle\", '\"I am glad that you have found what the matter with your engine was,\" he said', '\"Now you can go back home\"\\n\"How do you know about that', '\" I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope', 'He made no answer to my question, but he added: \"I, too, am going back home today', '\" Then, sadly, \"It is much farther', 'it is much more difficult', '\" I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening', 'I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him', 'His look was very serious, like someone lost far away', '\"I have your sheep', \"And I have the sheep's box\", 'And I have the muzzle', '\"\\nAnd he gave me a sad smile', 'I waited a long time', 'I could see that he was reviving little by little', '\"Dear little man,\" I said to him, \"you are afraid', '\" He was afraid; there was no doubt about that', 'But he laughed lightly', '\"I shall be much more afraid this evening', '\"\\nOnce again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable', 'And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more', 'For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert', '\"Little man,\" I said, \"I want to hear you laugh again', '\" But he said to me: \"Tonight, it will be a year', 'my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago', '\"\\n\"Little man,\" I said, \"tell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star', '\" But he did not answer my plea', 'He said to me, instead: \"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen', '\" \"Yes, I know', '\"\\n\"It is just as it is with the flower', 'If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night', 'All the stars are a-bloom with flowers', '\"\\n\"Yes, I know', '\"\\n\"It is just as it is with the water', 'Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music', 'You remember how good it was', '\"\\n\"Yes, I know', '\"\\n\"And at night you will look up at the stars', 'Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found', 'It is better, like that', 'My star will just be one of the stars, for you', 'And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens', 'they will all be your friends', 'And, besides, I am going to make you a present', '\" He laughed again', '\"Ah, little prince, dear little prince', 'I love to hear that laughter', '\"\\n\"That is my present', 'Just that', 'It will be as it was when we drank the water', '\"\\n\"What are you trying to say', '\"\\n\"All men have the stars,\" he answered, \"but they are not the same things for different people', 'For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides', 'For others they are no more than little lights in the sky', 'For others, who are scholars, they are problems', 'For my businessman they were wealth', 'But all these stars are silent', 'You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them\"\\n\"What are you trying to say', '\"\\n\"In one of the stars I shall be living', 'In one of them I shall be laughing', 'And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night', 'you, only you, will have stars that can laugh', '\"\\nAnd he laughed again', '\"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me', 'You will always be my friend', 'You will want to laugh with me', 'And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure', 'and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky', \"Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh\", \"' And they will think you are crazy\", 'It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you', '\"\\nAnd he laughed again', '\"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh', '\"\\nAnd he laughed again', 'Then he quickly became serious: \"Tonight, you know', 'do not come,\" said the little prince', '\"I shall not leave you,\" I said', '\"I shall look as if I were suffering', 'I shall look a little as if I were dying', 'It is like that', 'Do not come to see that', 'It is not worth the trouble', '\"\\n\"I shall not leave you', '\"\\nBut he was worried', '\"I tell you, it is also because of the snake', 'He must not bite you', 'Snakes, they are malicious creatures', 'This one might bite you just for fun', '\"\\n\"I shall not leave you', '\"\\nBut a thought came to reassure him: \"It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite', '\"\\nThat night I did not see him set out on his way', 'He got away from me without making a sound', 'When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step', 'He said to me merely: \"Ah', 'You are there', '\" And he took me by the hand', 'But he was still worrying', '\"It was wrong of you to come', 'You will suffer', 'I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true', '\"\\nI said nothing', '\"You understand', 'it is too far', 'I cannot carry this body with me', 'It is too heavy', '\"\\nI said nothing', '\"But it will be like an old abandoned shell', 'There is nothing sad about old shells', '\"\\nI said nothing', 'He was a little discouraged', 'But he made one more effort: \"You know, it will be very nice', 'I, too, shall look at the stars', 'All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley', 'All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink', '\"\\nI said nothing', '\"That will be so amusing', 'You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water', '\" And he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying', '\"Here it is', 'Let me go on by myself', '\" And he sat down, because he was afraid', 'Then he said, again: \"You know my flower', 'I am responsible for her', 'And she is so weak', 'She has four thorns, of no use at all, to protect herself against the entire world', '\"\\nI too sat down, because I was not able to stand up any longer', '\"There now, that is all', '\"\\nHe still hesitated a little; then he got up', 'He took one step', 'I could not move', 'There was nothing but a flash of yellow close to his ankle', 'He remained motionless for an instant', 'He did not cry out', 'He fell as gently as a tree falls', 'There was not even any sound, because of the sand', 'And now six years have already gone by', 'I have never yet told this story', 'The companions who met me on my return were well content to see me alive', 'I was sad, but I told them: \"I am tired', '\" Now my sorrow is comforted a little', 'That is to say, not entirely', 'But I know that he did go back to his planet, because I did not find his body at daybreak', 'It was not such a heavy body', 'and at night I love to listen to the stars', 'It is like five hundred million little bells', 'But there is one extraordinary thing', 'when I drew the muzzle for the little prince; I forgot to add the leather strap to it', 'He will never have been able to fasten it on his sheep', 'So now I keep wondering: what is happening on his planet', 'Perhaps the sheep has eaten the flower', 'At one time I say to myself: \"Surely not', 'The little prince shuts his flower under her glass globe every night, and he watches over his sheep very carefully', '\" Then I am happy', 'And there is sweetness in the laughter of all the stars', 'But at another time I say to myself: \"At some moment or other one is absent-minded, and that is enough', 'On some one evening he forgot the glass globe, or the sheep got out, without making any noise, in the night', '\" And then the little bells are changed to tears', 'Here, then, is a great mystery', 'For you who also love the little prince, and for me, nothing in the universe can be the same if somewhere, we do not know where,

ever understand that this is a matter of so much importance', 'This is, to me, the loveliest and saddest landscape in the world', 'It is the same as that on the preceding page, but I have drawn it again to impress it on your memory', 'It is here that the little prince appeared on Earth, and disappeared', 'Look at it carefully so that you will be sure to recognize it in case you travel some day to the African desert', 'And, if you should come upon this spot, please do not hurry on', 'Wait for a time, exactly under the star', 'Then, if a little man appears who laughs, who has golden hair and

begin, and I hope by this means\\nto deliver the people from the terror that reigns over them', '\" \\nDinarzade replied that she would do with pleasure what her\\nsister wished', 'When the usual hour arrived the grand-vizir conducted Scheherazade\\nto the palace, and left her alone with the Sultan, who bade her raise\\nher veil and was amazed at her beauty', 'But seeing her eyes full\\nof tears,

'He was obliged\\nfrom time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs', 'One day, having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse,\\ntaking with him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuits\\nand dates, because he had to pass through the desert where no food\\nwas to be got', 'He arrived without any mishap, and, having finished\\nhis business, set out on his return', 'On the fourth day of his journey,\\nthe heat of the sun being very great, he turned out of his road\\nto rest under some trees', 'He found at the foot of a large\\nwalnut-tree a fountain of clear and running water', 'He dismounted,\\nfastened his horse to a branch of the tree, and sat by the fountain,\\nafter having taken from his wallet some of his dates and biscuits', 'When he had finished this frugal mean he washed his face and hands\\nin the fountain', 'When he was thus employed he saw an enormous genius, white with rage,\\ncoming towards him, with a scimitar in his hand', '\"Arise,\" he cried in a terrible voice, \"and let me kill you as you\\nhave killed my son', '\"\\n\\nAs he uttered these words he gave a frightful yell', 'The merchant,\\nquite as much terrified at the hideous face of the monster as at\\nhis words, answered him tremblingly, \"Alas, good sir, what can I\\nhave done to you to deserve death', '\"\\n\\n\"I shall kill you,\" repeated the genius, \"as you have killed my son', '\"\\n\\n\"But,\" said the merchant, \"How can I have killed your son', 'I do not know him, and I have never even seen him', '\"\\n\\n\"When you arrived here did you not sit down on the ground', '\"\\nasked the genius, \"and did you not take some dates from your wallet,\\nand whilst eating them did not you throw the stones about', '\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the merchant, \"I certainly did so', '\"\\n\\n\"Then,\" said the genius, \"I tell you you have killed my son,\\nfor whilst you were throwing about the stones, my son passed by,\\nand one of them struck him in the eye and killed him', 'So

them towards the bank he felt a great weight', 'He though he had caught a large fish, and he felt very pleased', 'But a moment afterwards, seeing that instead of a fish he only had in\\nhis nets the carcase of an ass, he was much disappointed', 'Vexed with having such a bad haul, when he had mended his nets,\\nwhich the carcase of the ass had broken in several places, he threw\\nthem a second time', 'In drawing them in he again felt a great weight,\\nso that he thought they were full of fish', 'But he only found a large\\nbasket full of rubbish', 'He was much annoyed', '\"O Fortune,\" he cried, \"do not trifle thus with me, a poor fisherman,\\nwho can hardly support his family', '\"\\n\\nSo saying, he threw away the rubbish, and after having washed his\\nnets clean of the dirt, he threw them for the third time', 'But he\\nonly drew in stones, shells, and mud', 'He was almost in despair', 'Then he threw his nets for the fourth time', 'When he thought he had\\na fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble', 'There was no\\nfish however, but he found a yellow pot, which by its weight seemed\\nfull of something, and he noticed that it was fastened and sealed\\nwith lead, with the impression of a seal', 'He was delighted', '\"I will sell it to the founder,\" he said; \"with the money I shall\\nget for it I shall buy a measure of wheat', '\"\\n\\nHe examined the jar on all sides; he shook it to see if it would rattle', 'But he heard nothing, and so, judging from the impression of the seal\\nand the lid, he thought there must be something precious inside', 'To find out, he took his knife, and with a little trouble he opened it', 'He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which surprised\\nhim very much', 'He set it in front of him, and whilst he was\\nlooking at it attentively, such a thick smoke came out that he\\nhad to step back a pace or two', 'This smoke rose up to the clouds,\\nand stretching over the sea and the shore, formed a thick mist,\\nwhich caused the fisherman much astonishment', 'When all the smoke\\nwas out of the jar it gathered itself together, and became a thick\\nmass in which appeared a genius, twice as large as the largest giant', 'When he saw such a terrible-looking monster, the fisherman would\\nlike to have run away, but he trembled so with fright that he could\\nnot move a step', '\"Great king of the genii,\" cried the monster, \"I will never again\\ndisobey you', '\"\\n\\nAt these words the fisherman took courage', '\"What is this you are saying, great genius', 'Tell me your history\\nand how you came to be shut up in that vase', '\"\\n\\nAt this, the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily', '\"speak to me\\nmore civilly,\" he said, \"before I kill you', '\"\\n\\n\"Alas', 'why should you kill me', '\" cried the fisherman', '\"I have just\\nfreed you; have you already forgotten that', '\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered the genius; \"but that will not prevent me from\\nkilling you; and I am only going to grant you one favour,\\nand that is to choose the manner of your death', '\"\\n\\n\"But what have I don to you', '\" asked the fisherman', '\"I cannot treat you in any other way,\" said the genius, \"and if you\\nwould know why, listen to my story', '\"\\n\\n\"I rebelled against the king of the genii', 'To punish me, he shut\\nme up in this vase of copper, and he put on the leaden cover\\nhis seal, which is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out', 'Then he had the vase thrown into the sea', 'During the first period\\nof my captivity I vowed that if anyone should free me before a hundred\\nyears were passed, I would make him rich even after his death', 'But that century passed, and no one freed me', 'In the second century I\\nvowed that I would give all the treasures in the world to my deliverer;\\nbut he never came', '\"\\n\\n\"In the third, I promised to make him a king, to be always near him,\\nand to grant him three wishes every day; but that century passed\\naway as the other two had done, and I remained in the same plight', 'At last I grew angry at being captive for so long, and I vowed\\nthat if anyone would release me I would kill him at once,\\nand would only allow him to choose in what manner he should die', 'So you see, as you have freed me to-day, choose in what way you\\nwill die', '\"\\n\\nThe fisherman was very unhappy', '\"What an unlucky man I am to have\\nfreed you', 'I implore you to spare my life', '\"\\n\\n\"I have told you,\" said the genius, \"that it is impossible', 'Choose quickly; you are wasting time', '\"\\n\\nThe fisherman began to devise a plot', '\"Since I must die,\" he said, \"before I choose the manner of my death,\\nI conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were in\\nthat vase', '\"\\n\\n\"Yes, I was\" answered the genius', '\"I really cannot believe it,\" said the fisherman', '\"That vase could\\nnot contain one of your feet even, and how could your whole body\\ngo in', 'I cannot believe it unless I see you do the thing', '\"\\n\\nThen the genius began to change himself into smoke, which, as before,\\nspread over the sea and the shore, and which, then collecting\\nitself together, began to go back into the vase slowly and evenly\\ntill there was nothing left outside', 'Then a voice came from the\\nvase which said to the fisherman, \"Well, unbelieving fisherman,\\nhere I am in the vase; do you believe me now', '\"\\n\\nThe fisherman instead of answering took the lid of lead and shut\\nit down quickly on the vase', '\"Now, O genius,\" he cried, \"ask pardon of me, and choose by what death\\nyou will die', 'But no, it will be better if I throw you into the sea\\nwhence I drew you out, and I will build a house on the shore to warn\\nfishermen who come to cast their nets here, against fishing up such\\na wicked genius as you are, who vows to kill the man who frees you', '\"\\n\\nAt these words the genius did all he could to get out, but he\\ncould not, because of the enchantment of the lid', 'Then he tried to get out by cunning', '\"If you will take off the cover,\" he said, \"I will repay you', '\"\\n\\n\"No,\" answered the fisherman, \"if I trust myself to you I\\nam afraid you will treat me as a certain Greek king treated\\nthe physician Douban', 'Listen, and I will tell you', '\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Story of the Greek

thousand sequins', 'The following day he continued\\nto load him with favours', 'Now the king had a grand-vizir who was avaricious, and envious,\\nand a very bad man', 'He grew extremely jealous of

said the fisherman to the genius,\\n\"had finished the story of the parrot, he added to the vizir,\\n\"And so, vizir, I shall not listen to you, and I shall take\\ncare of the physician, in case I repent as the husband did\\nwhen he had killed the parrot', '\"  But the vizir was determined', '\"Sire,\" he replied, \"the death of the parrot was nothing', 'But when it is a question of the life of a king it is better to\\nsacrifice the innocent than save the guilty', 'It is no uncertain\\nthing, however', 'The physician, Douban, wishes to assassinate you', 'My zeal prompts me to disclose this to your Majesty', 'If I am wrong,\\nI deserve to be punished as a vizir was once punished', '\"  \"What had\\nthe vizir done,\" said the Greek king, \"to merit the punishment', '\" \\n\"I will tell your Majesty, if you will do me the honour to listen,\"\\nanswered the vizir', '\"\\n\\n\\n\\nThe Story of the Vizir Who Was Punished\\n\\n\\nThere was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fond\\nof hunting', 'He often allowed him to indulge in this pastime,\\nbut he had ordered his grand-vizir always to go with him,\\nand never to lose sight of him', 'One day the huntsman roused a stag,\\nand the prince, thinking that the vizir was behind, gave chase,\\nand rode so hard that he found himself alone', 'He stopped,\\nand having lost sight of it, he turned to rejoin the vizir,\\nwho had not been careful enough to follow him', 'But he lost his way', 'Whilst he was trying to find it, he saw on the side of the road\\na beautiful lady who was crying bitterly', \"He drew his horse's rein,\\nand asked her who she was and what she was doing in this place,\\nand if she needed help\", '\"I am the daughter of an Indian king,\"\\nshe answered, \"and whilst riding in the country I fell asleep and\\ntumbled off', 'My horse has run away, and I do not know what has become\\nof him', '\"\\n\\nThe young prince had pity on her, and offered to take her behind him,\\nwhich he did', 'As they passed by a ruined building the lady dismounted\\nand went in', 'The prince also dismounted and followed her', 'To his great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside,\\n\"Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth', '\"  And other\\nvoices replied, \"Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at once,\\nas we are very hungry', '\"\\n\\nThe prince at once saw the danger he was in', 'He now knew that the\\nlady who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an ogress,\\nwho lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles surprised\\nand devoured passers-by', 'He was terrified, and threw himself on\\nhis horse', 'The pretended princess appeared at this moment, and seeing\\nthat she had lost her prey, she said to him, \"Do not be afraid', 'What do you want', '\"\\n\\n\"I am lost,\" he answered, \"and I am looking for the road', '\"\\n\\n\"Keep straight on,\" said the ogress, \"and you will find it', '\"\\n\\nThe prince could hardly believe his ears, and rode off as hard\\nas he could', \"He found his way, and arrived safe and sound at\\nhis father's house, where he told him of the danger he had run\\nbecause of the grand-vizir's carelessness\", 'The king was very angry,\\nand had him strangled immediately', '\"Sire,\" went on the vizir to the Greek king, \"to return to\\nthe physician, Douban', 'If you do not take care, you will repent\\nof having trusted him', 'Who knows what this remedy, with which\\nhe has cured you, may not in time have a bad effect on you', '\"\\n\\nThe Greek king was naturally very weak, and did not perceive\\nthe wicked intention of his vizir, nor was he firm enough to keep\\nto his first resolution', '\"Well, vizir,\" he said, \"you are right', 'Perhaps he did come to take\\nmy life', 'Me might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs', 'I must see what can be done', '\"\\n\\n\"The best means, sire, to put your life in security, is to send\\nfor him at once, and to cut off his head directly he comes,\"\\nsaid the vizir', '\"I really think,\" replied the king, \"that will be the best way', '\"\\n\\nHe then ordered one of his ministers to fetch the physician,\\nwho came at once', '\"I have had you sent for,\" said the king, \"in order to free myself\\nfrom you by taking your life', '\"\\n\\nThe physician was beyond measure astonished when he heard he was\\nto die', '\"What crimes have I committed, your majesty', '\"\\n\\n\"I have learnt,\" replied the king, \"that you are a spy, and intend\\nto kill me', 'But I will be first, and kill you', 'Strike,\" he added\\nto an executioner who was by, \"and rid me of this assassin', '\"\\n\\nAt this cruel order the physician threw himself on his knees', '\"Spare my life,\" he cried, \"and yours will be spared', '\"\\n\\nThe fisherman stopped here to say to the genius:  \"You see what\\npassed between the Greek king and the physician has just passed\\nbetween us two', 'The Greek king,\" he went on, \"had no mercy on him,\\nand the executioner bound his eyes', '\"\\n\\nAll those present begged for his life, but in vain', 'The physician on his knees, and bound, said to the king: \\n\"At least let me put my affairs in order, and leave my books\\nto persons who will make good use of them', 'There is one which I\\nshould like to present to your majesty', 'It is very precious,\\nand ought to be kept carefully in your treasury', 'It contains\\nmany curious things the chief being that when you cut off my head,\\nif your majesty will turn to the sixth leaf, and read the third\\nline of the left-hand page, my head will answer all the questions\\nyou like to ask it', '\"\\n\\nThe kin, eager to see such a wonderful thing, put off his execution\\nto the next day, and sent him under a strong guard to his house', 'There the physician put his affairs in order, and the next day\\nthere was a great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death,\\nand the doings after it', 'The physician went up to the foot\\nof the throne with a large book in his hand', 'He carried a basin,\\non which he spread the covering of the book, and presenting it to\\nthe king, said:  \"Sire, take this book, and when my head is cut off,\\nlet it be placed in the basin on the covering of this book; as soon\\nas it is there, the blood will cease to flow', 'Then open the book,\\nand my head will answer your questions', 'But, sire, I implore your mercy,\\nfor I am innocent', '\"\\n\\n\"Your prayers are useless, and if it were only to hear your head\\nspeak when you are dead, you should die', '\"\\n\\nso saying, he took the book from the physician\\'s hands, and ordered\\nthe executioner to do his duty', 'The head was so cleverly cut off that it fell into the basin,\\nand directly the blood ceased to flow', 'Then, to the great astonishment\\nof the king, the eyes opened, and the head said, \"Your majesty,\\nopen the book', '\"  The king did so, and finding that the first leaf\\nstuck against the second, he put his finger in his mouth, to turn it\\nmore easily', 'He did the same thing till he reached the sixth page,\\nand not seeing any writing on it, \"Physician,\" he said, \"there is\\nno writing', '\"\\n\\n\"Turn over a few more pages,\" answered the head', 'The king went\\non turning, still putting his finger in his mouth, till the poison\\nin which each page was dipped took effect', 'His sight failed him,\\nand he fell at the foot of his throne', 'When the physician\\'s head saw that the poison had taken effect,\\nand that the king had only a few more minutes to live,\\n\"Tyrant,\" it cried, \"see how cruelty and injustice are punished', '\"\\n\\nScarcely had it uttered these words than the king died, and the head\\nlost also the little life that had remained in it', 'That is the end of the story of the Greek king, and now let us\\nreturn to the fisherman and the genius', '\"If the Greek king,\" said the fisherman, \"had spared the physician,\\nhe would not have thus died', 'The same thing applies to you', 'Now I am going to throw you into the sea', '\"\\n\\n\"My friend,\" said the genius, \"do not do such a cruel thing', 'Do not treat me as Imma treated Ateca', '\"\\n\\n\"What did Imma do to Ateca', '\" asked the fisherman', '\"Do you think I can tell you while I am shut up in here', '\"\\nreplied the genius', '\"Let me out, and I will make you rich', '\"\\n\\nThe hope of being no longer poor made the fisherman give way', '\"If you will give me your promise to do this, I will open the lid', 'I do not think you will dare to break your word', '\"\\n\\nThe genius promised, and the fisherman lifted the lid', 'He came\\nout at once in smoke, and then, having resumed his proper form,\\nthe first thing he did was to kick the vase into the sea', 'This frightened the fisherman, but the genius laughed and said,\\n\"Do not be afraid; I only did it to frighten you, and to show you\\nthat I intend to keep my word; take your nets and follow me', '\"\\n\\nHe began to walk in front of the fisherman, who followed him\\nwith some misgivings', 'They passed in front of the town, and went\\nup a mountain and then down into a great plain, where there\\nwas a large lake lying between four hills', 'When they reached the lake the genius said to the fisherman,\\n\"Throw your nets and catch fish', '\"\\n\\nThe fisherman did as he was told, hoping for a good catch,\\nas he saw plenty of fish', 'What was his astonishment at seeing\\nthat there were four quite different kinds, some white, some red,\\nsome blue, and some yellow', 'He caught four, one of each colour', 'As he had never seen any like them he admired them very much,\\nand he was very please to think how much money he would get\\nfor them', '\"Take these fish and carry them to the Sultan, who will give you more\\nmoney for them than you have ever had in your life', 'You can come\\nevery day to fish in this lake, but be careful not to throw your nets\\nmore than once every day, otherwise some harm will happen to you', 'If you follow my advice carefully you will find it good', '\"\\n\\nSaying these words, he struck his foot against the ground,\\nwhich opened, and when he had disappeared, it closed immediately', 'The fisherman resolved to obey the genius exactly, so he did\\nnot cast his nets a second time, but walked into the town to sell\\nhis fish at the palace', 'When the Sultan saw the fish he was much astonished', 'He looked at\\nthem one after the other, and when he had admired them long enough,\\n\"Take these fish,\" he said to his first vizir, \"and given them\\nto the clever cook the Emperor of the Greeks sent me', 'I think they\\nmust be as good as they are beautiful', '\"\\n\\nThe vizir took them himself to the cook, saying, \"Here are four fish\\nthat have been brought to the Sultan', 'He wants you to cook them', '\"\\n\\nThen he went back to the Sultan, who told him to give the fisherman\\nfour hundred gold pieces', 'The fisherman, who had never before\\npossessed such a large sum of money at once, could hardly believe\\nhis good fortune', 'He at once relieved the needs of his family,\\nand made good use of it', 'But now we must return to the kitchen, which we shall find\\nin great confusion', 'The cook, when she had cleaned the fish,\\nput them in a pan with some oil to fry them', 'When she thought\\nthem cooked enough on one side she turned them on the other', 'But scarcely had she done so when the walls of the kitchen opened,\\nand there came out a young and beautiful damsel', 'She was dressed\\nin an Egyptian dress of flowered satin, and she wore earrings,\\nand a necklace of white pearls, and bracelets of gold set with rubies,\\nand she held a wand of myrtle in her hand', 'She went up to the pan, to the great astonishment of the cook,\\nwho stood motionless at the sight of her', 'She struck one of the fish\\nwith her rod, \"Fish, fish,\" said she, \"are you doing your duty', '\" \\nThe fish answered nothing, and then she repeated her question,\\nwhereupon they all raised their heads together and answered\\nvery distinctly, \"Yes, yes', 'If you reckon, we reckon', 'If you\\npay your debts, we pay ours', 'If you fly, we conquer, and we\\nare content', '\"\\n\\nWhen they had spoken the girl upset the pan, and entered the opening\\nin the wall, which at once closed, and appeared the same as before', 'When the cook had recovered from her fright she lifted up the fish\\nwhich had fallen into the ashes, but she found them as black as cinders,\\nand not fit to serve up to the Sultan', 'She began to cry', '\"Alas', 'what shall I say to the Sultan', 'He will be so angry with me,\\nand I know he will not believe me', '\"\\n\\nWhilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in and asked\\nif the fish were ready', 'She told him all that had happened,\\nand he was much surprised', 'He sent at once for the fisherman,\\nand when he came

not say what the genius had told him, but he\\nexcused himself from bringing them that day on account of the length\\nof the way, and he promised to bring them next day', 'In the night he went to the lake, cast his nets, and on drawing\\nthem in found four fish, which were like the others, each of\\na different colour', 'He went back at once and carried them to the grand-vizir as he\\nhad promised', 'He then took them to the kitchen and shut himself up with the cook,\\nwho began to cook them as she had done the four others on the\\nprevious day', 'When she was about to turn them on the

astonishment', '\"I shall tell\\nthe Sultan all that has happened,\" said he', 'And he did so', 'The Sultan was very much astounded, and wished to see this marvel\\nfor himself', 'So he sent for the fisherman, and asked him to procure\\nfour more fish', 'The fisherman asked for three days, which were granted,\\nand he then cast his nets in the lake, and again caught four different\\ncoloured fish', 'The sultan was delighted to see he had got them,\\nand gave him again four hundred gold pieces', 'As soon as the Sultan had the fish he had them carried to his room\\nwith all that was needed to cook them', 'Then he shut himself up with the grand-vizir, who began to prepare\\nthem and cook them', 'When they were done on one side he turned them\\nover on the other', 'Then the wall of the room opened, but instead\\nof the maiden a black slave came out', 'He was enormously tall,\\nand carried a large green stick with which he touched the fish,\\nsaying in a terrible voice, \"Fish, fish, are you doing your duty', '\" \\nTo these words the fish lifting up their heads replied, \"Yes, yes', 'If you reckon, we reckon', 'If you pay your debts, we pay ours', 'If you fly, we conquer, and are content', '\"\\n\\nThe black slave overturned the pan in the middle of the room,\\nand the fish were turned to cinders', 'Then he stepped proudly back\\ninto the wall, which closed round him', '\"After having seen this,\" said the Sultan, \"I cannot rest', 'These fish signify some mystery I must clear up', '\"\\n\\nHe sent for the fisherman', '\"Fisherman,\" he said, \"the fish you\\nhave brought us have caused me some anxiety', 'Where did you get\\nthem from', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" he answered, \"I got them from a lake which lies in the\\nmiddle of four hills beyond yonder mountains', '\"\\n\\n\"Do you know this lake', '\" asked the Sultan of the grand-vizir', '\"No; though I have hunted many times round that mountain, I have\\nnever heard of it,\" said the vizir', \"As the fisherman said it was only three hours' journey away,\\nthe sultan ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither,\\nand the fisherman led them\", 'They climbed the mountain, and then, on the other side, saw the\\nlake as the fisherman had described', 'The water was so clear\\nthat they could see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it', 'They looked at them for some time, and then the Sultan ordered them\\nto make a camp by the edge of the water', 'When night came the Sultan called his vizir, and said to him,\\n\"I have resolved to clear up this mystery', 'I am going out alone,\\nand do you stay here in my tent, and when my ministers come to-morrow,\\nsay I am not well, and cannot see them', 'Do this each day till\\nI return', '\"\\n\\nThe grand-vizir tried to persuade the Sultan not to go, but in vain', 'The Sultan took off his state robe and put on his sword, and when he\\nsaw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone', 'He climbed one of the hills, and then crossed the great plain, till,\\njust as the sun rose, he beheld far in front of him a large building', 'When he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace of beautiful\\nblack polished marble, covered with steel as smooth as a mirror', 'He went to the gate, which stood half open, and went in, as nobody\\ncame when he knocked', 'He passed through a magnificent courtyard\\nand still saw no one, though he called aloud several times', 'He entered large halls where the carpets were of silk, the lounges\\nand sofas covered with tapestry from Mecca, and the hangings of the most\\nbeautiful Indian stuffs of gold and silver', 'Then he found himself\\nin a splendid room, with a fountain supported by golden lions', \"The water out of the lions' mouths turned into diamonds and pearls,\\nand the leaping water almost touched a most beautifully-painted dome\", 'The palace was surrounded on three sides by magnificent gardens,\\nlittle lakes, and woods', 'Birds sang in the trees, which were netted\\nover to keep them always there', 'Still the Sultan saw no one, till he heard a plaintive cry,\\nand a voice which said, \"Oh that I could die, for I am too unhappy\\nto wish to live any longer', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan looked round to discover who it was who this bemoaned\\nhis fate, and at last saw a handsome young man, richly clothed,\\nwho was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground', 'His face was very sad', 'The sultan approached him and bowed to him', 'The young man bent\\nhis head very low, but did not rise', '\"Sire,\" he said to the Sultan, \"I cannot rise and do you\\nthe reverence that I am sure should be paid to your rank', '\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" answered the Sultan, \"I am sure you have a good reason\\nfor not doing so, and having heard your cry of distress, I am come\\nto offer you my help', 'Whose is this palace, and why is it thus empty', '\"\\n\\nInstead of answering the young man lifted up his robe, and showed\\nthe Sultan that, from the waist downwards, he was a block of black marble', 'The Sultan was horrified, and begged the young man to tell him\\nhis story', '\"Willingly I will tell you my sad history,\" said the young man', 'The Story of the Young King of the Black Isles\\n\\n\\nYou must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud, the king of this\\ncountry, the Black Isles, so called from the four little mountains\\nwhich were once islands, while the capital was the place where now\\nthe great lake lies', 'My story will tell you how these changes came about', 'My father died when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him', 'I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she loved\\nme too', 'But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and was being fanned\\nby two of her maids, I heard one say to the other, \"What a pity it\\nis that our mistress no longer loves our master', 'I believe she\\nwould like to kill him if she could, for she is an enchantress', '\"\\n\\nI soon found by watching that they were right, and when I\\nmortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime,\\nshe begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where she\\nwept and bewailed him for two years', 'At last I begged her to cease grieving for him, for although he could\\nnot speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him alive', 'She turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic words,\\nand I instantly became as you see me now, half man and half marble', 'Then this wicked enchantress changed the capital, which was\\na very populous and flourishing city, into the lake and desert\\nplain you saw', 'The fish of four colours which are in it are\\nthe different races who lived in the town; the four hills are\\nthe four islands which give the name to my kingdom', 'All this the\\nenchantress told me to add to my troubles', 'And this is not all', 'Every day she comes and beats me with a whip of buffalo hide', 'When the young king had finished his sad story he burst once more\\ninto tears, and the Sultan was much moved', '\"Tell me,\" he cried, \"where is this wicked woman, and where is\\nthe miserable object of her affection, whom she just manages\\nto keep alive', '\"\\n\\n\"Where she lives I do not know,\" answered the unhappy prince, \\n\"but she goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet speak\\nto her, after she has beaten me', '\"\\n\\n\"Unfortunate king,\" said the Sultan, \"I will do what I can\\nto avenge you', '\"\\n\\nSo he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring\\nthis about, and they agreed their plan should be put in effect\\nthe next day', 'The Sultan then rested, and the young king gave\\nhimself up to happy hopes of release', 'The next day the Sultan arose,\\nand then went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was', 'He drew his sword and destroyed the little life that remained in him,\\nand then threw the body down a well', 'He then lay down on the couch\\nwhere the slave had been, and waited for the enchantress', 'She went first to the young king, whom she beat with a hundred blows', 'Then she came to the room where she thought her wounded slave was,\\nbut where the Sultan really lay', 'She came near his couch and said, \"Are you better to-day,\\nmy dear slave', 'Speak but one word to me', '\"\\n\\n\"How can I be better,\" answered the Sultan, imitating the language\\nof the Ethiopians, \"when I can never sleep for the cries and groans\\nof your husband', '\"\\n\\n\"What joy to hear you speak', '\" answered the queen', '\"Do you wish\\nhim to regain his proper shape', '\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" said the Sultan; \"hasten to set him at liberty, so that I\\nmay no longer hear his cries', '\"\\n\\nThe queen at once went out and took a cup of water, and said\\nover it some words

for vengeance', 'Go quickly,\\nand give them their proper shape', '\"\\n\\nThe enchantress hurried away and said some words over the lake', 'The fish then became men, women, and children, and the houses\\nand shops were once more filled', \"The Sultan's suite, who had\\nencamped by the lake, were not a little astonished to see themselves\\nin the middle of a large and beautiful town\", 'As

recite verses', 'In fact, they were all enjoying themselves mightily when they heard\\na knock at the outer door, which Sadie rose to open', 'She soon\\nreturned saying that three Calenders, all blind in the right eye,\\nand all with their heads, faces, and eyebrows clean shaved,\\nbegged for admittance, as they were newly arrived in Bagdad,\\nand night had already fallen', '\"They seem to have pleasant manners,\"\\nshe added, \"but you have no idea how funny they look', 'I am sure\\nwe should find their company diverting', '\"\\n\\nZobeida and Amina made some difficulty about admitting the new comers,\\nand Sadie knew the reason of their hesitation', 'But she urged\\nthe matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last forced to consent', '\"Bring them in, then,\" said she, \"but make them understand that\\nthey are not to make remarks about what does not concern them,\\nand be sure to make them read the inscription over the door', '\" \\nFor on the door was written in letters of gold, \"Whoso meddles in\\naffairs that are no business of his, will hear truths that will not\\nplease him', '\"\\n\\nThe three Calenders bowed low on entering, and thanked the ladies\\nfor their kindness and hospitality', 'The ladies replied with words\\nof welcome, and they were all about to seat themselves when the eyes\\nof the Calenders fell on the porter, whose dress was not so very unlike\\ntheir own, though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him', '\"This,\" said one of them, \"is apparently one of our Arab brothers,\\nwho has rebelled against our ruler', '\"\\n\\nThe porter, although half asleep from the wine he had drunk,\\nheard the words, and without moving cried angrily to the Calender,\\n\"Sit down and mind your own business', 'Did you not read the inscription\\nover the door', 'Every-body is not obliged to live in the same way', '\"\\n\\n\"Do not be so angry, my good man,\" replied the Calender; \"we should\\nbe very sorry to displease you;\" so the quarrel was smoothed over,\\nand supper began in good earnest', 'When the Calenders had satisfied\\ntheir hunger, they offered to play to their hostesses, if there were\\nany instruments in the house', 'The ladies were delighted at the idea,\\nand Sadie went to see what she could find, returning in a few\\nmoments laden with two different kinds of flutes and a tambourine', 'Each Calender took the one he preferred, and began to play\\na well-known air, while the ladies sang the words of the song', 'These words were the gayest and liveliest possible, and every now\\nand then the singers had to stop to indulge the laughter which almost\\nchoked them', 'In the midst of all their noise, a knock was heard\\nat the door', 'Now early that evening the Caliph secretly left the palace,\\naccompanied by his grand-vizir, Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs,\\nall three wearing the dresses of merchants', 'Passing down the street,\\nthe Caliph had been attracted by the music of instruments and the sound\\nof laughter, and had ordered his vizir to go and knock at the door\\nof the house, as he wished to enter', 'The vizir replied that the ladies\\nwho lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends, and he thought\\nhis master would do well not to intrude on them; but the Caliph had\\ntaken it into his head to see for himself, and insisted on being obeyed', 'The knock was answered by Sadie, with a taper in her hand,\\nand the vizir, who was surprised at her beauty, bowed low before her,\\nand said respectfully, \"Madam, we are three merchants who have\\nlately arrived from Moussoul, and, owing to a misadventure which\\nbefel us this very night, only reached our inn to find that the\\ndoors were closed to us till to-morrow morning', 'Not knowing\\nwhat to do, we wandered in the streets till we happened to pass\\nyour house, when, seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices,\\nwe resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the dawn', 'If you will grant us this favour, we will, with your permission,\\ndo all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly', '\"\\n\\nSadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her sisters;\\nand after having talked over the matter with them, she returned to tell\\nhim that he and his two friends would be welcome to join their company', 'They entered and bowed politely to the ladies and their guests', 'Then Zobeida, as the mistress, came forward and said gravely,\\n\"You are welcome here, but I hope you will allow me to beg one thing\\nof you--have as many eyes as you like, but no tongues; and ask\\nno questions about anything you see, however strange it may appear\\nto you', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" returned the vizir, \"you shall be obeyed', 'We have quite\\nenough to please and interest us without troubling ourselves about\\nthat with which we have no concern', '\"  Then they all sat down,\\nand drank to the health of the new comers', 'While the vizir, Giafar, was talking to the ladies the Caliph\\nwas occupied in wondering who they could be, and why the three\\nCalenders had each lost his right eye', \"He was burning to inquire\\nthe reason of it all, but was silenced by Zobeida's request, so he\\ntried to rouse him-self and to take his part in the conversation,\\nwhich was very lively, the subject of discussion being the many\\ndifferent sorts of pleasures that there were in the world\", 'After some time the Calenders got up and performed some curious dances,\\nwhich delighted the rest of the company', 'When they had finished Zobeida rose from her seat, and, taking Amina\\nby the hand, she said to her, \"My sister, our friends will excuse us\\nif we seem to forget their presence and fulfil our nightly task', '\" \\nAmina understood her sister\\'s meaning, and collecting the dishes,\\nglasses, and musical instruments, she carried them away, while Sadie\\nswept the hall and put everything in order', 'Having done this she\\nbegged the Calenders to sit on a sofa on one side of the room,\\nand the Caliph and his friends to place themselves opposite', 'As to the porter, she requested him to come and help her and\\nher sister', 'Shortly after Amina entered carrying a seat, which she put down\\nin the middle of the empty space', 'She next went over to the door\\nof a closet and signed to the porter to follow her', 'He did so,\\nand soon reappeared leading two black dogs by a chain, which he\\nbrought into the centre of the hall', 'Zobeida then got up from her\\nseat between the Calenders and the Caliph and walked slowly across\\nto where the porter stood with the dogs', '\"We must do our duty,\"\\nshe said with a deep sigh, pushing back her sleeves, and, taking a\\nwhip from Sadie, she said to the man, \"Take one of those dogs to my\\nsister Amina and give me the other', '\"\\n\\nThe porter did as he was bid, but as he led the dog to Zobeida it\\nuttered piercing howls, and gazed up at her with looks of entreaty', 'But Zobeida took no notice, and whipped the dog till she was\\nout of breath', \"She then took the chain from the porter, and,\\nraising the dog on its hind legs, they looked into each other's eyes\\nsorrowfully till tears began to fall from both\", 'Then Zobeida took\\nher handkerchief and wiped the dog\\'s eyes tenderly, after which she\\nkissed it, then, putting the chain into the porter\\'s hand she said,\\n\"Take it back to the closet and bring me the other', '\"\\n\\nThe same ceremony was gone through with the second dog,\\nand all the while the whole company looked on with astonishment', 'The Caliph in particular could hardly contain himself, and made\\nsigns to the vizir to ask what it all meant', 'But the vizir\\npretended not to see, and turned his head away', 'Zobeida remained for some time in the middle of the room, till at\\nlast Sadie went up to her and begged her to sit down, as she\\nalso had her part to play', 'At these words Amina fetched a lute\\nfrom a case of yellow satin and gave it to Sadie, who sang several\\nsongs to its accompaniment', 'When she was tired she said to Amina,\\n\"My sister, I can do no more; come, I pray you, and take my place', '\"\\n\\nAmina struck a few chords and then broke into a song, which she\\nsang with so much ardour that she was quite overcome, and sank\\ngasping on a pile of cushions, tearing open her dress as she did\\nso to give herself some air', 'To the amazement of all present,\\nher neck, instead of being as smooth and white as her face,\\nwas a mass of scars', 'The Calenders and the Caliph looked at each other, and whispered together,\\nunheard by Zobeida and Sadie, who were tending their fainting sister', '\"What does it all mean', '\" asked the Caliph', '\"We know no more than you,\" said the Calender to whom he had spoken', '\"What', 'You do not belong to the house', '\"\\n\\n\"My lord,\" answered all the Calenders together, \"we came here\\nfor the first time an hour before you', '\"\\n\\nThey then turned to the porter to see if he could explain\\nthe mystery, but the porter was no wiser than they were themselves', 'At length the Caliph could contain his curiosity no longer,\\nand declared that he would compel the ladies to tell them the meaning\\nof their strange conduct', 'The vizir, foreseeing what would happen,\\nimplored him to remember the condition their hostesses had imposed,\\nand added in a whisper that if his Highness would only wait till\\nmorning he could as Caliph summon the ladies to appear before him', 'But the Caliph, who was not accustomed to be contradicted,\\nrejected this advice, and it was resolved after a little more talking\\nthat the question should be put by the porter', 'Suddenly Zobeida\\nturned round, and seeing their excitement she said, \"What is the matter--\\nwhat are you all discussing so earnestly', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" answered the porter, \"these gentlemen entreat you to explain\\nto them why you should first whip the dogs and then cry over them,\\nand also how it happens that the fainting lady is covered with scars', 'They have requested me, Madam, to be their mouthpiece', '\"\\n\\n\\n\"Is it true, gentlemen,\" asked Zobeida, drawing herself up,\\n\"that you have charged this man to put me that question', '\"\\n\\n\"It is,\" they all replied, except Giafar, who was silent', '\"Is this,\" continued Zobeida, growing more angry every moment,\\n\"is this the return you make for the hospitality I have shown you', 'Have you forgotten the one condition on which you were allowed\\nto enter the house', 'Come quickly,\" she added, clapping her hands\\nthree times, and the words were hardly uttered when seven black slaves,\\neach armed with a sabre, burst in and stood over the seven men,\\nthrowing them on the ground, and preparing themselves, on a sign from\\ntheir mistress, to cut off their heads', \"The seven culprits all thought their last hour had come, and the\\nCaliph repented bitterly that he had not taken the vizir's advice\", \"But they made up their minds to die bravely, all except the porter,\\nwho loudly inquired of Zobeida why he was to suffer for other\\npeople's faults, and declared that these misfortunes would never\\nhave happened if it had not been for the Calenders, who always\\nbrought ill-luck\", 'He ended by imploring Zobeida not to confound\\nthe innocent with the guilty and to spare his life', 'In spite of her anger, there was something so comic in the groans\\nof the porter that Zobeida could not refrain from laughing', 'But putting him aside she addressed the others a second time,\\nsaying, \"Answer me; who are you', 'Unless you tell me truly you\\nhave not another moment to live', 'I can hardly think you are men\\nof any position, whatever country you belong to', 'If you were,\\nyou would have had more consideration for us', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph, who was naturally very impatient, suffered far more\\nthan either of the others at feeling that his life was at the\\nmercy of a justly offended lady, but when he heard her question\\nhe began to breathe more freely, for he was convinced that she\\nhad only to learn his name and rank for all danger to be over', 'So he whispered hastily to the vizir, who was next to him,\\nto reveal their secret', 'But the vizir, wiser than his master,\\nwished to conceal from the public the affront they had received,\\nand merely answered, \"After all, we have only got what we deserved', '\"\\n\\nMeanwhile Zobeida had turned to the three Calenders and inquired if,\\nas they were all blind, they were brothers', '\"No, madam,\" replied one, \"we are no blood relations at all,\\nonly brothers by our mode of life', '\"\\n\\n\"And you,\" she asked, addressing another, \"were you born blind\\nof one eye', '\"\\n\\n\"No, madam,\" returned he, \"I became blind through a most surprising\\nadventure, such as probably has never happened to anybody', 'After that I shaved my head and eyebrows and put on the dress\\nin which you see me now', '\"\\n\\nZobeida put the same question to the other two Calenders,\\nand received the same answer', '\"But,\" added the third, \"it may interest you, madam, to know\\nthat we are not men of low birth, but are all three sons of kings,\\nand of kings, too, whom the world holds in high esteem', '\"\\n\\nAt these words Zobeida\\'s anger cooled down, and she turned to\\nher slaves and said, \"You can give them a little more liberty,\\nbut do not leave the hall', 'Those that will tell us their histories\\nand their reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave unhurt;\\nthose who refuse--\" And she paused, but in a moment the porter,\\nwho understood that he had only to relate his story to set himself\\nfree from this terrible danger, immediately broke in,\\n\\n\"Madam, you know already how I came here, and what I have to say\\nwill soon be told', 'Your sister found me this morning in the place\\nwhere I always stand waiting to be hired', 'She bade me follow her\\nto various shops, and when my basket was quite full we returned\\nto this house, when you had the goodness to permit me to remain,\\nfor which I shall be eternally grateful', 'That is my story', '\"\\n\\nHe looked anxiously to Zobeida, who nodded her head and said,\\n\"You can go; and take care we never meet again', '\"\\n\\n\"Oh, madam,\" cried the porter, \"let me stay yet a little while', 'It is not just that the others should have heard my story and that I\\nshould not hear theirs,\" and without waiting for permission he\\nseated himself on the end of the sofa occupied by the ladies,\\nwhilst the rest crouched on the carpet, and the slaves stood against\\nthe wall', 'Then one of the Calenders, addressing himself to Zobeida as the\\nprincipal lady, began his story', 'The Story of the First Calender, Son of a King\\n\\n\\nIn order, madam, to explain how I came to lose my right eye,\\nand to wear the dress of a Calender, you must first know that I\\nam the son of a king', \"My father's only brother reigned over the\\nneighbouring country, and had two children, a daughter and a son,\\nwho were of the same age as myself\", \"As I grew up, and was allowed more liberty, I went every year to pay\\na visit to my uncle's court, and usually stayed there about two months\", 'In this way my cousin and I became very intimate, and were much\\nattached to each other', 'The very last time I saw him he seemed more\\ndelighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my honour', 'When we had finished eating, he said to me, \"My cousin, you would\\nnever guess what I have been doing since your last visit to us', 'Directly after your departure I set a number of men to work on a building\\nafter my own design', 'It is now completed, and ready to be lived in', 'I should like to show it to you, but you must first swear two things: \\nto be faithful to me, and to keep my secret', '\"\\n\\nOf course I did not dream of refusing him anything he asked, and gave\\nthe promise without the least hesitation', 'He then bade me wait\\nan instant, and vanished, returning in a few moments with a richly\\ndressed lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me her name,\\nI thought it was better not to inquire', \"We all three sat down to table\\nand amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things,\\nand with drinking each other's health\", 'Suddenly the prince said to me,\\n\"Cousin, we have no time to lose; be so kind as to conduct this lady\\nto a certain spot, where you will find a dome-like tomb, newly built', 'You cannot mistake it', 'Go in, both of you, and wait till I come', 'I shall not be long', '\"\\n\\nAs I had promised I prepared to do as I was told, and giving my hand\\nto the lady, I escorted her, by the light of the moon, to the place\\nof which the prince had spoken', 'We had barely reached it when he\\njoined us himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe,\\nand a little bag containing plaster', 'With the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchre\\nin the middle of the tomb', 'One by one he took the stones and piled\\nthem up in a corner', 'When he had knocked down the whole sepulchre\\nhe proceeded to dig at the earth, and beneath where the sepulchre\\nhad been I saw a trap-door', 'He raised the door and I caught sight\\nof the top of a spiral staircase; then he said, turning to the lady,\\n\"Madam, this is the way that will lead you down to the spot which I\\ntold you of', '\"\\n\\nThe lady did not answer, but silently descended the staircase,\\nthe prince following her', 'At the top, however, he looked at me', '\"My cousin,\" he exclaimed, \"I do not know how to thank you for\\nyour kindness', 'Farewell', '\"\\n\\n\"What do you mean', '\"  I cried', '\"I don\\'t understand', '\"\\n\\n\"No matter,\" he replied, \"go back by the path that you came', '\"\\n\\nHe would say no more, and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my room\\nin the palace and went to bed', 'When I woke, and considered\\nmy adventure, I thought that I must have been dreaming, and sent\\na servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me', 'But on hearing that he had not slept at home I was much alarmed,\\nand hastened to the cemetery, where, unluckily, the tombs were all so\\nalike that I could not discover which was the one I was in search of,\\nthough I spent four days in looking for it', 'You must know that all this time the king, my uncle, was absent\\non a hunting expedition, and as no one knew when he would be back,\\nI at last decided to return home, leaving the ministers to make\\nmy excuses', 'I longed to tell them what had become of the prince,\\nabout whose fate they felt the most dreadful anxiety, but the oath I\\nhad sworn kept me silent', \"On my arrival at my father's capital, I was astonished to find\\na large detachment of guards drawn up before the gate of the palace;\\nthey surrounded me directly I entered\", 'I asked the officers in command\\nthe reason of this strange behaviour, and was horrified to learn\\nthat the army had mutinied and put to death the king, my father,\\nand had placed the grand-vizir on the throne', 'Further, that by his\\norders I was placed under arrest', 'Now this rebel vizir had hated me from my boy-hood, because once,\\nwhen shooting at a bird with a bow, I had shot out his eye by accident', 'Of course I not only sent a servant at once to offer him my regrets\\nand apologies, but I made them in person', 'It was all of no use', 'He cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no occasion\\nof showing it', 'Having once got me in his power I felt he could\\nshow no mercy, and I was right', 'Mad with triumph and fury he\\ncame to me in my prison and tore out my right eye', 'That is how I\\nlost it', 'My persecutor, however, did not stop here', 'He shut me up in a large\\ncase and ordered his executioner to carry me into a desert place,\\nto cut off my head, and then to abandon my body to the birds of prey', 'The case, with me inside it, was accordingly placed on a horse,\\nand the executioner, accompanied by another man, rode into the country\\nuntil they found a spot suitable for the purpose', 'But their hearts\\nwere not so hard as they seemed, and my tears and prayers made\\nthem waver', '\"Forsake the kingdom instantly,\" said the executioner at last,\\n\"and take care never to come back, for you will not only lose\\nyour head, but make us lose ours', '\"  I thanked him gratefully,\\nand tried to console myself for the loss of my eye by thinking\\nof the other misfortunes I had escaped', 'After all I had gone through, and my fear of being recognised\\nby some enemy, I could only travel very slowly and cautiously,\\ngenerally resting in some out-of-the-way place by day, and walking\\nas far as I was able by night, but at length I arrived in the kingdom\\nof my uncle, of whose protection I was sure', 'I found him in great trouble about the disappearance of his son,\\nwho had, he said, vanished without leaving a trace; but his own grief\\ndid not prevent him sharing mine', 'We mingled our tears, for the loss\\nof one was the loss of the other, and then I made up my mind that it\\nwas my duty to break the solemn oath I had sworn to the prince', 'I therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything I knew,\\nand I observed that even before I had ended his sorrow appeared to be\\nlightened a little', '\"My dear nephew,\" he said, \"your story gives me some hope', 'I was aware that my son was building a tomb, and I think I can find\\nthe spot', 'But as he wished to keep the matter secret, let us go\\nalone and seek the place ourselves', '\"\\n\\nHe then bade me disguise myself, and we both slipped out of a\\ngarden door which opened on to the cemetery', \"It did not take\\nlong for us to arrive at the scene of the prince's disappearance,\\nor to discover the tomb I had sought so vainly before\", 'We entered it, and found the trap-door which led to the staircase,\\nbut we had great difficulty in raising it, because the prince had\\nfastened it down underneath with the plaster he had brought with him', 'My uncle went first, and I followed him', 'When we reached the bottom\\nof the stairs we stepped into a sort of ante-room, filled with\\nsuch a dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see anything', 'However, we passed through the smoke into a large chamber,\\nwhich at first seemed quite empty', 'The room was brilliantly lighted,\\nand in another moment we perceived a sort of platform at one end,\\non which were the bodies of the prince and a lady, both half-burned,\\nas if they had been dragged out of a fire before it had quite\\nconsumed them', 'This horrible sight turned me faint, but, to my surprise, my uncle\\ndid not show so much surprise as anger', '\"I knew,\" he said, \"that my son was tenderly attached to this lady,\\nwhom it was impossible he should ever marry', 'I tried to turn\\nhis thoughts, and presented to him the most beautiful princesses,\\nbut he cared for none of them, and, as you see, they have now been\\nunited by a horrible death in an underground tomb', '\"  But, as he spoke,\\nhis anger melted into tears, and again I wept with him', 'When he recovered himself he drew me to him', '\"My dear nephew,\"\\nhe said, embracing me, \"you have come to me to take his place,\\nand I will do my best to forget that I ever had a son who could act\\nin so wicked a manner', '\"  Then he turned and went up the stairs', 'We reached the palace without anyone having noticed our absence,\\nwhen, shortly after, a clashing of drums, and cymbals, and the blare\\nof trumpets burst upon our astonished ears', 'At the same time a thick\\ncloud of dust on the horizon told of the approach of a great army', 'My heart sank when I perceived that the commander was the vizir\\nwho had dethroned my father, and was come to seize the kingdom\\nof my uncle', 'The capital was utterly unprepared to stand a siege, and seeing\\nthat resistance was useless, at once opened its gates', 'My uncle\\nfought hard for his life, but was soon overpowered, and when he\\nfell I managed to escape through a secret passage, and took refuge\\nwith an officer whom I knew I could trust', 'Persecuted by ill-fortune, and stricken with grief, there seemed\\nto be only one means of safety left to me', 'I shaved my beard\\nand my eyebrows, and put on the dress of a calender, in which it\\nwas easy for me to travel without being known', 'I avoided the towns\\ntill I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph,\\nHaroun-al-Raschid, when I had no further reason to fear my enemies', 'It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feet\\nof his Highness, who would, I felt certain, be touched by my sad story,\\nand would grant me, besides, his help and protection', 'After a journey which lasted some months I arrived at length at the\\ngates of this city', 'It was sunset, and I paused for a little to look\\nabout me, and to decide which way to turn my steps', 'I was still\\ndebating on this subject when I was joined by this other calender,\\nwho stopped to greet me', '\"You, like me, appear to be a stranger,\"\\nI said', 'He replied that I was right, and before he could say more\\nthe third calender came up', 'He, also, was newly arrived in Bagdad,\\nand being brothers in misfortune, we resolved to cast in our\\nlots together, and to share whatever fate might have in store', 'By this time it had grown late, and we did not know where to spend\\nthe night', 'But our lucky star having guided us to this door,\\nwe took the liberty of knocking and of asking for shelter,\\nwhich was given to us at once with the best grace in the world', 'This, madam, is my story', '\"I am satisfied,\" replied Zobeida; \"you can go when you like', '\"\\n\\nThe calender, however, begged leave to stay and to hear the histories\\nof his two friends and of the three other persons of the company,\\nwhich he was allowed to do', 'The Story of the Second Calendar, Son of a King\\n\\n\\n\"Madam,\" said the young man, addressing Zobeida, \"if you wish\\nto know how I lost my right eye, I shall have to tell you the story\\nof my whole life', '\"\\n\\nI was scarcely more than a baby, when the king my father,\\nfinding me unusually quick and clever for my age, turned his\\nthoughts to my education', 'I was taught first to read and write,\\nand then to learn the Koran, which is the basis of our holy religion,\\nand the better to understand it, I read with my tutors the ablest\\ncommentators on its teaching, and committed to memory all the\\ntraditions respecting the Prophet, which have been gathered from\\nthe mouth of those who were his friends', 'I also learnt history,\\nand was instructed in poetry, versification, geography, chronology,\\nand in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should excel', 'But what I liked best of all was writing Arabic characters,\\nand in this I soon surpassed my masters, and gained a reputation\\nin this branch of knowledge that reached as far as India itself', 'Now the Sultan of the Indies, curious to see a young prince\\nwith such strange tastes, sent an ambassador to my father,\\nladen with rich presents, and a warm invitation to visit his court', 'My father, who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of so\\npowerful a monarch, and held besides that a little travel would\\ngreatly improve my manners and open my mind, accepted gladly,\\nand in a short time I had set out for India with the ambassador,\\nattended only by a small suite on account of the length of the journey,\\nand the badness of the roads', 'However, as was my duty, I took\\nwith me ten camels, laden with rich presents for the Sultan', 'We had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a cloud\\nof dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came near,\\nwe found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers', 'Our men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered by\\nthe camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to overawe\\nthem by informing them who we were, and whither we were going', 'The robbers, however, only laughed, and declared that was none\\nof their business, and, without more words, attacked us brutally', 'I defended myself to the last, wounded though I was, but at length,\\nseeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the ambassador\\nand all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horse\\nand rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell dead\\nfrom a wound in his side', 'I managed to jump off without any injury,\\nand looked about to see if I was pursued', 'But for the moment I\\nwas safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged in\\nquarrelling over their booty', 'I found myself in a country that was quite new to me, and dared\\nnot return to the main road lest I should again fall into the\\nhands of the robbers', 'Luckily my wound was only a slight one,\\nand after binding it up as well as I could, I walked on for the\\nrest of the day, till I reached a cave at the foot of a mountain,\\nwhere I passed the night in peace, making my supper off some fruits\\nI had gathered on the way', 'I wandered about for a whole month without knowing where I was going,\\ntill at length I found myself on the outskirts of a beautiful city,\\nwatered by winding streams, which enjoyed an eternal spring', 'My delight at the prospect of mixing once more with human beings was\\nsomewhat damped at the thought of the miserable object I must seem', 'My face and hands had been burned nearly black; my clothes were all\\nin rags, and my shoes were in such a state that I had been forced to\\nabandon them altogether', 'I entered the town, and stopped at a tailor s shop to inquire\\nwhere I was', 'The man saw I was better than my condition,\\nand begged me to sit down, and in return I told him my whole story', 'The tailor listened with attention, but his reply, instead of giving\\nme consolation, only increased my trouble', '\"Beware,\" he said, \"of telling any one what you have told me,\\nfor the prince who governs the kingdom is your father\\'s greatest enemy,\\nand he will be rejoiced to find you in his power', '\"\\n\\nI thanked the tailor for his counsel, and said I would do whatever\\nhe advised; then, being very hungry, I gladly ate of the food he\\nput before me, and accepted his offer of a lodging in his house', 'In a few days I had quite recovered from the hardships I had undergone,\\nand then the tailor, knowing that it was the custom for the princes\\nof our religion to learn a trade or profession so as to provide for\\nthemselves in times of ill-fortune, inquired if there was anything\\nI could do for my living', 'I replied that I had been educated\\nas a grammarian and a poet, but that my great gift was writing', '\"All that is of no use here,\" said the tailor', '\"Take my advice,\\nput on a short coat, and as you seem hardy and strong, go into\\nthe woods and cut firewood, which you will sell in the streets', 'By this means you will earn your living, and be able to wait till\\nbetter times come', 'The hatchet and the cord shall be my present', '\"\\n\\nThis counsel was very distasteful to me, but I thought I could not\\ndo otherwise than adopt it', 'So the next morning I set out with a\\ncompany of poor wood-cutters, to whom the tailor had introduced me', 'Even on the first day I cut enough wood to sell for a tolerable sum,\\nand very soon I became more expert, and had made enough money\\nto repay the tailor all he had lent me', 'I had been a wood-cutter for more than a year, when one day I\\nwandered further into the forest than I had ever done before,\\nand reached a delicious green glade, where I began to cut wood', 'I was hacking at the root of a tree, when I beheld an iron ring fastened\\nto a trapdoor of the same metal', 'I soon cleared away the earth,\\nand pulling up the door, found a staircase, which I hastily made up\\nmy mind to go down, carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection', 'When I reached the bottom I discovered that I was in a huge palace,\\nas brilliantly lighted as any palace above ground that I had ever seen,\\nwith a long gallery supported by pillars of jasper, ornamented with\\ncapitals of gold', 'Down this gallery a lady came to meet me,\\nof such beauty that I forgot everything else, and thought only\\nof her', 'To save her all the trouble possible, I hastened towards her,\\nand bowed low', '\"Who are you', 'Who are you', '\" she said', '\"A man or a genius', '\"\\n\\n\"A man, madam,\" I replied; \"I have nothing to do with genii', '\"\\n\\n\"By what accident do you come here', '\" she asked again with a sigh', '\"I have been in this place now for five and twenty years, and you are\\nthe first man who has visited me', '\"\\n\\nEmboldened by her beauty and gentleness, I ventured to reply,\\n\"Before, madam, I answer your question, allow me to say how grateful I\\nam for this meeting, which is not only a consolation to me in my own\\nheavy sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render your lot happier,\"\\nand then I told her who I was, and how I had come there', '\"Alas, prince,\" she said, with a deeper sigh than before, \"you have\\nguessed rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in this\\ngorgeous place', 'I am the daughter of the king of the Ebony Isle,\\nof whose fame you surely must have heard', \"At my father's desire I was\\nmarried to a prince who was my own cousin; but on my very wedding day,\\nI was snatched up by a genius, and brought here in a faint\", 'For a long while I did nothing but weep, and would not suffer\\nthe genius to come near me; but time teaches us submission,\\nand I have now got accustomed to his presence, and if clothes and\\njewels could content me, I have them in plenty', 'Every tenth day,\\nfor five and twenty years, I have received a visit from him,\\nbut in case I should need his help at any other time, I have only\\nto touch a talisman that stands at the entrance of my chamber', 'It wants still five days to his next visit, and I hope that during\\nthat time you will do me the honour to be my guest', '\"\\n\\nI was too much dazzled by her beauty to dream of refusing her offer,\\nand accordingly the princess had me conducted to the bath,\\nand a rich dress befitting my rank was provided for me', 'Then a feast of the most delicate dishes was served in a room\\nhung with embroidered Indian fabrics', 'Next day, when we were at dinner, I could maintain my patience\\nno longer, and implored the princess to break her bonds, and return\\nwith me to the world which was lighted by the sun', '\"What you ask is impossible,\" she answered; \"but stay here with\\nme instead, and we can be happy, and all you will have to do\\nis to betake yourself to the forest every tenth day, when I am\\nexpecting my master the genius', 'He is very jealous, as you know,\\nand will not suffer a man to come near me', '\"\\n\\n\"Princess,\" I replied, \"I see it is only fear of the genius that\\nmakes you act like this', 'For myself, I dread him so little that I\\nmean to break his talisman in pieces', 'Awful though you think him,\\nhe shall feel the weight of my arm, and I herewith take a solemn\\nvow to stamp out the whole race', '\"\\n\\nThe princess, who realized the consequences of such audacity,\\nentreated me not to touch the talisman', '\"If you do, it will be the\\nruin of both of us,\" said she; \"I know genii much better than you', '\" \\nBut the wine I had drunk had confused my brain; I gave one kick\\nto the talisman, and it fell into a thousand pieces', 'Hardly had my foot touched the talisman when the air became as dark\\nas night, a fearful noise was heard, and the palace shook to its\\nvery foundations', 'In an instant I was sobered, and understood\\nwhat I had done', '\"Princess', '\"  I cried, \"what is happening', '\"\\n\\n\"Alas', '\" she exclaimed, forgetting all her own terrors in anxiety\\nfor me, \"fly, or you are lost', '\"\\n\\nI followed her advice and dashed up the staircase, leaving my\\nhatchet behind me', 'But I was too late', 'The palace opened and the\\ngenius appeared, who, turning angrily to the princess, asked indignantly,\\n\\n\"What is the matter, that you have sent for me like this', '\"\\n\\n\"A pain in my heart,\" she replied hastily, \"obliged me to seek\\nthe aid of this little bottle', 'Feeling faint, I slipped and fell\\nagainst the talisman, which broke', 'That is really all', '\"\\n\\n\"You are an impudent liar', '\" cried the genius', '\"How did this hatchet\\nand those shoes get here', '\"\\n\\n\"I never saw them before,\" she answered, \"and you came in such\\na hurry that you may have picked them up on the road without\\nknowing it', '\"  To this the genius only replied by insults and blows', 'I could hear the shrieks and groans of the princess, and having\\nby this time taken off my rich garments and put on those in which I\\nhad arrived the previous day, I lifted the trap, found myself\\nonce more in the forest, and returned to my friend the tailor,\\nwith a light load of wood and a heart full of shame and sorrow', 'The tailor, who had been uneasy at my long absence, was, delighted to\\nsee me; but I kept silence about my adventure, and as soon as\\npossible retired to my room to lament in secret over my folly', 'While I was thus indulging my grief my host entered, and said,\\n\"There is an old man downstairs who has brought your hatchet\\nand slippers, which he picked up on the road, and now restores\\nto you, as he found out from one of your comrades where you lived', 'You had better come down and speak to him yourself', '\"  At this\\nspeech I changed colour, and my legs trembled under me', 'The tailor\\nnoticed my confusion, and was just going to inquire the reason\\nwhen the door of the room opened, and the old man appeared,\\ncarrying with him my hatchet and shoes', '\"I am a genius,\" he said, \"the son of the daughter of Eblis,\\nprince of the genii', 'Is not this hatchet yours, and these shoes', '\" \\nWithout waiting for an answer--which, indeed, I could hardly\\nhave given him, so great was my fright--he seized hold of me,\\nand darted up into the air with the quickness of lightning,\\nand then, with equal swiftness, dropped down towards the earth', 'When he touched the ground, he rapped it with his foot; it opened,\\nand we found ourselves in the enchanted palace, in the presence\\nof the beautiful princess of the Ebony Isle', 'But how different she\\nlooked from what she was when I had last seen her, for she was lying\\nstretched on the ground covered with blood, and weeping bitterly', '\"Traitress', '\" cried the genius, \"is not this man your lover', '\"\\n\\nShe lifted up her eyes slowly, and looked sadly at me', '\"I never\\nsaw him before, she answered slowly', 'I do not know who he is', '\"\\n\\n\"What', '\" exclaimed the genius, \"you owe all your sufferings to him,\\nand yet you dare to say he is a stranger to you', '\"\\n\\n\"But if he really is a stranger to me,\" she replied, \"why should I\\ntell a lie and cause his death', '\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the genius, drawing his sword, \"take this,\\nand cut off his head', '\"\\n\\n\"Alas,\" answered the princess, \"I am too weak even to hold the sabre', 'And supposing that I had the strength, why should I put an innocent\\nman to death', '\"\\n\\n\"You condemn yourself by your refusal,\" said the genius; then turning\\nto me, he added, \"and you, do you not know her', '\"\\n\\n\"How should I', '\"  I replied, resolved to imitate the princess\\nin her fidelity', '\"How should I, when I never saw her before', '\"\\n\\n\"Cut her head off,\" then, \"if she is a stranger to you, and I shall\\nbelieve you are speaking the truth, and will set you at liberty', '\"\\n\\n\"Certainly,\" I answered, taking the sabre in my hands, and making\\na sign to the princess to fear nothing, as it was my own life that I\\nwas about to sacrifice, and not hers', 'But the look of gratitude\\nshe gave me shook my courage, and I flung the sabre to the earth', '\"I should not deserve to live,\" I said to the genius, \"if I were\\nsuch a coward as to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me,\\nbut who is at this moment half dead herself', 'Do with me as you will--\\nI am in your power--but I refuse to obey your cruel command', '\"\\n\\n\"I see,\" said the genius, \"that you have both made up your minds\\nto brave me, but I will give you a sample of what you may expect', '\"\\nSo saying, with one sweep of his sabre he cut off a hand of the princess,\\nwho was just able to lift the other to wave me an eternal farewell', 'Then I lost consciousness for several minutes', 'When I came to myself I implored the genius to keep me no longer\\nin this state of suspense, but to lose no time in putting an end to\\nmy sufferings', 'The genius, however, paid no attention to my prayers,\\nbut said sternly, \"That is the way in which a genius treats the woman\\nwho has betrayed him', 'If I chose, I could kill you also; but I\\nwill be merciful, and content myself with changing you into a dog,\\nan ass, a lion, or a bird--which-ever you prefer', '\"\\n\\nI caught eagerly at these words, as giving me a faint hope\\nof softening his wrath', '\"O genius', '\"  I cried, \"as you wish\\nto spare my life, be generous, and spare it altogether', 'Grant my prayer, and pardon my crime, as the best man in the whole\\nworld forgave his neighbour who was eaten up with envy of him', '\" \\nContrary to my hopes, the genius seemed interested in my words,\\nand said he would like to hear the story of the two neighbours;\\nand as I think, madam, it may please you, I will tell it to you also', 'The Story of the Envious Man and of Him Who Was Envied\\n\\n\\nIn a town of moderate size, two men lived in neighbouring houses;\\nbut they had not been there very long before one man took such a\\nhatred of the other, and envied him so bitterly, that the poor man\\ndetermined to find another home, hoping that when they no longer\\nmet every day his enemy would forget all about him', 'So he sold\\nhis house and the little furniture it contained, and moved into\\nthe capital of the country, which was luckily at no great distance', 'About half a mile from this city he bought a nice little place,\\nwith a large garden and a fair-sized court, in the centre of which\\nstood an old well', 'In order to live a quieter life, the good man put on the robe\\nof a dervish, and divided his house into a quantity of small cells,\\nwhere he soon established a number of other dervishes', 'The fame of his virtue gradually spread abroad, and many people,\\nincluding several of the highest quality, came to visit him and ask\\nhis prayers', 'Of course it was not long before his reputation reached the ears of\\nthe man who envied him, and this wicked wretch resolved never to rest\\ntill he had in some way worked ill to the dervish whom he hated', 'So he left his house and his business to look after themselves,\\nand betook himself to the new dervish monastery, where he was\\nwelcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable', 'The excuse\\nhe gave for his appearance was that he had come to consult the\\nchief of the dervishes on a private matter of great importance', '\"What I have to say must not be overheard,\" he whispered;\\n\"command, I beg of you, that your dervishes retire into their cells,\\nas night is approaching, and meet me in the court', '\"\\n\\nThe dervish did as he was asked without delay, and directly they\\nwere alone together the envious man began to tell a long story,\\nedging, as they walked to and fro, always nearer to the well, and when\\nthey were quite close, he seized the dervish and dropped him in', 'He then ran off triumphantly, without having been seen by anyone,\\nand congratulating himself that the object of his hatred was dead,\\nand would trouble him no more', 'But in this he was mistaken', 'The old well had long been inhabited\\n(unknown to mere human beings) by a set of fairies and genii,\\nwho caught the dervish as he fell, so that he received no hurt', 'The dervish himself could see nothing, but he took for granted that\\nsomething strange had happened, or he must certainly have been dashed\\nagainst the side of the well and been killed', 'He lay quite still,\\nand in a moment he heard a voice saying, \"Can you guess whom this man\\nis that we have saved from death', '\"\\n\\n\"No,\" replied several other voices', 'And the first speaker answered, \"I will tell you', 'This man,\\nfrom pure goodness of heart, forsook the town where he lived and\\ncame to dwell here, in the hope of curing one of his neighbours\\nof the envy he felt towards him', \"But his character soon won him\\nthe esteem of all, and the envious man's hatred grew, till he\\ncame here with the deliberate intention of causing his death\", 'And this he would have done, without our help, the very day before\\nthe Sultan has arranged to visit this holy dervish, and to entreat\\nhis prayers for the princess, his daughter', '\"\\n\\n\"But what is the matter with the princess that she needs\\nthe dervish\\'s prayers', '\" asked another voice', '\"She has fallen into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of Dimdim,\"\\nreplied the first voice', '\"But it would be quite simple for this\\nholy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew', 'In his\\nconvent there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its tail', 'Now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of these\\nwhite hairs, burn three, and with their smoke perfume the head\\nof the princess', 'This will deliver her so completely that Maimoum,\\nthe son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her again', '\"\\n\\nThe fairies and genii ceased talking, but the dervish did not forget\\na word of all they had said; and when morning came he perceived\\na place in the side of the well which was broken, and where he\\ncould easily climb out', 'The dervishes, who could not imagine what had become of him,\\nwere enchanted at his reappearance', 'He told them of the attempt on\\nhis life made by his guest of the previous day, and then retired into\\nhis cell', 'He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voice\\nhad spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master', 'He took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull seven\\nwhite hairs out of his tail, and put them on one side till they\\nwere needed', 'The sun had not long risen before the Sultan, who was anxious\\nto leave nothing undone that might deliver the princess,\\narrived with a large suite at the gate of the monastery,\\nand was received by the dervishes with profound respect', 'The Sultan lost no time in declaring the object of his visit,\\nand leading the chief of the dervishes aside, he said to him,\\n\"Noble scheik, you have guessed perhaps what I have come to ask you', '\"\\n\\n\"Yes, sire,\" answered the dervish; \"if I am not mistaken, it is\\nthe illness of the princess which has procured me this honour', '\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" returned the Sultan, \"and you will give me fresh\\nlife if you can by your prayers deliver my daughter from the strange\\nmalady that has taken possession of her', '\"\\n\\n\"Let your highness command her to come here, and I will see what I\\ncan do', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan, full of hope, sent orders at once that the princess\\nwas to set out as soon as possible, accompanied by her usual staff\\nof attendants', 'When she arrived, she was so thickly veiled that\\nthe dervish could not see her face, but he desired a brazier to be\\nheld over her head, and laid the seven hairs on the burning coals', 'The instant they were consumed, terrific cries were heard,\\nbut no one could tell from whom they proceeded', 'Only the dervish\\nguessed that they were uttered by Maimoum the son of Dimdim,\\nwho felt the princess escaping him', 'All this time she had seemed unconscious of what she was doing,\\nbut now she raised her hand to her veil and uncovered her face', '\"Where am I', 'she said in a bewildered manner; and how did I\\nget here', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan was so delighted to hear these words that he not only\\nembraced his daughter, but kissed the hand of the dervish', 'Then, turning to his attendants who stood round, he said to them,\\n\"What reward shall I give to the man who has restored me my daughter', '\"\\n\\nThey all replied with one accord that he deserved the hand\\nof the princess', '\"That is my own opinion,\" said he, \"and from this moment I declare\\nhim to be my son-in-law', '\"\\n\\nShortly after these events, the grand-vizir died, and his post\\nwas given to the dervish', 'But he did not hold it for long, for the\\nSultan fell a victim to an attack of illness, and as he had no sons,\\nthe soldiers and priests declared the dervish heir to the throne,\\nto the great joy of all the people', 'One day, when the dervish, who had now become Sultan, was making\\na royal progress with his court, he perceived the envious man standing\\nin the crowd', 'He made a sign to one of his vizirs, and whispered in\\nhis ear, \"Fetch me that man who is standing out there, but take great\\ncare not to frighten him', '\"  The vizir obeyed, and when the envious man\\nwas brought before the Sultan, the monarch said to him, \"My friend,\\nI am delighted to see you again', '\"  Then turning to an officer,\\nhe added, \"Give him a thousand pieces of gold out of my treasury,\\nand twenty waggon-loads of merchandise out of my private stores,\\nand let an escort of soldiers accompany him home', '\"  He then took\\nleave of the envious man, and went on his way', 'Now when I had ended my story, I proceeded to show the genius\\nhow to apply it to himself', '\"O genius,\" I said, \"you see that this\\nSultan was not content with merely forgiving the envious man\\nfor the attempt on his life; he heaped rewards and riches upon him', '\"\\n\\nBut the genius had made up his mind, and could not be softened', '\"Do not imagine that you are going to escape so easily,\" he said', '\"All I can do is to give you bare life; you will have to learn what\\nhappens to people who interfere with me', '\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he seized me violently by the arm; the roof of the palace\\nopened to make way for us, and we mounted up so high into the air\\nthat the earth looked like a little cloud', 'Then, as before,\\nhe came down with the swiftness of lightning, and we touched\\nthe ground on a mountain top', 'Then he stooped and gathered a handful of earth, and murmured some\\nwords over it, after which he threw the earth in my face, saying as\\nhe did so, \"Quit the form of a man, and assume that of a monkey', '\" \\nThis done, he vanished, and I was in the likeness of an ape,\\nand in a country I had never seen before', 'However there was no use in stopping where I was, so I came down\\nthe mountain and found myself in a flat plain which was bounded\\nby the sea', 'I travelled towards it, and was pleased to see a\\nvessel moored about half a mile from shore', 'There were no waves,\\nso I broke off the branch of a tree, and dragging it down to the\\nwaters edge, sat across it, while, using two sticks for oars,\\nI rowed myself towards the ship', 'The deck was full of people, who watched my progress with interest,\\nbut when I seized a rope and swung myself on board, I found that I\\nhad only escaped death at the hands of the genius to perish\\nby those of the sailors, lest I should bring ill-luck to the\\nvessel and the merchants', '\"Throw him into the sea', '\" cried one', '\"Knock him on the head with a hammer,\" exclaimed another', '\"Let me\\nshoot him with an arrow,\" said a third; and certainly somebody\\nwould have had his way if I had not flung myself at the captain\\'s\\nfeet and grasped tight hold of his dress', 'He appeared touched\\nby my action and patted my head, and declared that he would take\\nme under his protection, and that no one should do me any harm', 'At the end of about fifty days we cast anchor before a large town,\\nand the ship was immediately surrounded by a multitude of small\\nboats filled with people, who had come either to meet their friends\\nor from simple curiosity', 'Among others, one boat contained several\\nofficials, who asked to see the merchants on board, and informed\\nthem that they had been sent by the Sultan in token of welcome,\\nand to beg them each to write a few lines on a roll of paper', '\"In order to explain this strange request,\" continued the officers,\\n\"it is necessary that you should know that the grand-vizir,\\nlately dead, was celebrated for his beautiful handwriting,\\nand the Sultan is anxious to find a similar talent in his successor', 'Hitherto the search has been a failure, but his Highness has not yet\\ngiven up hope', '\"\\n\\nOne after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll,\\nand when they had all finished, I came forward, and snatched\\nthe paper from the man who held it', 'At first they all thought I\\nwas going to throw it into the sea, but they were quieted when they\\nsaw I held it with great care, and great was their surprise when I\\nmade signs that I too wished to write something', '\"Let him do it if he wants to,\" said the captain', '\"If he only makes\\na mess of the paper, you may be sure I will punish him for it', 'But if, as I hope, he really can write, for he is the cleverest\\nmonkey I ever saw, I will adopt him as my son', 'The one I lost had\\nnot nearly so much sense', '\"\\n\\nNo more was said, and I took the pen and wrote the six sorts\\nof writing in use among the Arabs, and each sort contained\\nan original verse or couplet, in praise of the Sultan', 'And not\\nonly did my handwriting completely eclipse that of the merchants,\\nbut it is hardly too much to say that none so beautiful had ever\\nbefore been seen in that country', 'When I had ended the officials\\ntook the roll and returned to the Sultan', 'As soon as the monarch saw my writing he did not so much as look\\nat the samples of the merchants, but desired his officials to take\\nthe finest and most richly caparisoned horse in his stables,\\ntogether with the most magnificent dress they could procure,\\nand to put it on the person who had written those lines, and bring\\nhim to court', 'The officials began to laugh when they heard the Sultan\\'s command,\\nbut as soon as they could speak they said, \"Deign, your highness,\\nto excuse our mirth, but those lines were not written by a man\\nbut by a monkey', '\"\\n\\n\"A monkey', '\" exclaimed the Sultan', '\"Yes, sire,\" answered the officials', '\"They were written by a monkey\\nin our presence', '\"\\n\\n\"Then bring me the monkey,\" he replied, \"as fast as you can', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan\\'s officials returned to the ship and showed the royal\\norder to the captain', '\"He is the master,\" said the good man, and desired that I should\\nbe sent for', 'Then they put on me the gorgeous robe and rowed me to land, where I\\nwas placed on the horse and led to the palace', 'Here the Sultan\\nwas awaiting me in great state surrounded by his court', 'All the way along the streets I had been the object of curiosity\\nto a vast crowd, which had filled every doorway and every window,\\nand it was amidst their shouts and cheers that I was ushered into\\nthe presence of the Sultan', 'I approached the throne on which he was seated and made him three\\nlow bows, then prostrated myself at his feet to the surprise of everyone,\\nwho could not understand how it was possible that a monkey should\\nbe able to distinguish a Sultan from other people, and to pay him\\nthe respect due to his rank', 'However, excepting the usual speech,\\nI omitted none of the common forms attending a royal audience', 'When it was over the Sultan dismissed all the court, keeping with him\\nonly the chief of the eunuchs and a little slave', 'He then passed\\ninto another room and ordered food to be brought, making signs\\nto me to sit at table with him and eat', 'I rose from my seat,\\nkissed the ground, and took my place at the table, eating, as you\\nmay suppose, with care and in moderation', 'Before the dishes were removed I made signs that writing materials,\\nwhich stood in one corner of the room, should be laid in front of me', 'I then took a peach and wrote on it some verses in praise of the Sultan,\\nwho was speechless with astonishment; but when I did the same\\nthing on a glass from which I had drunk he murmured to himself,\\n\"Why, a man who could do as much would be cleverer than any other man,\\nand this is only a monkey', '\"\\n\\nSupper being over chessmen were brought, and the Sultan signed to me\\nto know if I would play with him', 'I kissed the ground and laid my hand\\non my head to show that I was ready to show myself worthy of the honour', 'He beat me the first game, but I won the second and third, and seeing\\nthat this did not quite please I dashed off a verse by way of consolation', 'The Sultan was so enchanted with all the talents of which I had given\\nproof that he wished me to exhibit some of them to other people', 'So turning to the chief of the eunuchs he said, \"Go and beg my daughter,\\nQueen of Beauty, to come here', 'I will show her something she has\\nnever seen before', '\"\\n\\nThe chief of the eunuchs bowed and left the room, ushering in a few\\nmoments later the princess, Queen of Beauty', 'Her face was uncovered,\\nbut the moment she set foot in the room she threw her veil over\\nher head', '\"Sire,\" she said to her father, \"what can you be thinking\\nof to summon me like this into the presence of a man', '\"\\n\\n\"I do not understand you,\" replied the Sultan', '\"There is nobody\\nhere but the eunuch, who is your own servant, the little slave,\\nand myself, yet you cover yourself with your veil and reproach me\\nfor having sent for you, as if I had committed a crime', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" answered the princess, \"I am right and you are wrong', 'This monkey is really no monkey at all, but a young prince who has\\nbeen turned into a monkey by the wicked spells of a genius, son of\\nthe daughter of Eblis', '\"\\n\\nAs will be imagined, these words took the Sultan by surprise, and he\\nlooked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess', 'As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head to show that it\\nwas true', '\"But how do you know this, my daughter', '\" asked he', '\"Sire,\" replied Queen of Beauty, \"the old lady who took care of me\\nin my childhood was an accomplished magician, and she taught me\\nseventy rules of her art, by means of which I could, in the twinkling\\nof an eye, transplant your capital into the middle of the ocean', 'Her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first sight all persons\\nwho are enchanted, and tells me by whom the spell was wrought', '\"\\n\\n\"My daughter,\" said the Sultan, \"I really had no idea you were\\nso clever', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the princess, \"there are many out-of-the-way things\\nit is as well to know, but one should never boast of them', '\"\\n\\n\"Well,\" asked the Sultan, \"can you tell me what must be done\\nto disenchant the young prince', '\"\\n\\n\"Certainly; and I can do it', '\"\\n\\n\"Then restore him to his former shape,\" cried the Sultan', '\"You could give me no greater pleasure, for I wish to make him\\nmy grand-vizir, and to give him to you for your husband', '\"\\n\\n\"As your Highness pleases,\" replied the princess', 'Queen of Beauty rose and went to her chamber, from which she\\nfetched a knife with some Hebrew words engraven on the blade', 'She then desired the Sultan, the chief of the eunuchs, the little\\nslave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace,\\nand placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round, she herself\\nstanding in the centre of the court', 'Here she traced a large\\ncircle and in it wrote several words in Arab characters', 'When the circle and the writing were finished she stood in the middle\\nof it and repeated some verses from the Koran', 'Slowly the air\\ngrew dark, and we felt as if the earth was about to crumble away,\\nand our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the genius,\\nson of the daughter of Eblis, suddenly appear under the form of a\\ncolossal lion', '\"Dog,\" cried the princess when she first caught sight of him,\\n\"you think to strike terror into me by daring to present yourself\\nbefore me in this hideous shape', '\"\\n\\n\"And you,\" retorted the lion, \"have not feared to break our treaty\\nthat engaged solemnly we should never interfere with each other', '\"\\n\\n\"Accursed genius', '\" exclaimed the princess, \"it is you by whom\\nthat treaty was first broken', '\"\\n\\n\"I will teach you how to give me so much trouble,\" said the lion,\\nand opening his huge mouth he advanced to swallow her', 'But the\\nprincess expected something of the sort and was on her guard', 'She bounded on one side, and seizing one of the hairs of his mane\\nrepeated two or three words over it', \"In an instant it became a sword,\\nand with a sharp blow she cut the lion's body into two pieces\", \"These pieces vanished no one knew where, and only the lion's\\nhead remained, which was at once changed into a scorpion\", 'Quick as thought the princess assumed the form of a serpent\\nand gave battle to the scorpion, who, finding he was getting\\nthe worst of it, turned himself into an eagle and took flight', 'But in a moment the serpent had become an eagle more powerful still,\\nwho soared up in the air and after him, and then we lost sight of\\nthem both', 'We all remained where we were quaking with anxiety, when the ground\\nopened in front of us and a black and white cat leapt out, its hair\\nstanding on end, and miauing frightfully', 'At its heels was a wolf,\\nwho had almost seized it, when the cat changed itself into a worm,\\nand, piercing the skin of a pomegranate which had tumbled from a tree,\\nhid itself in the fruit', 'The pomegranate swelled till it grew as\\nlarge as a pumpkin, and raised itself on to the roof of the gallery,\\nfrom which it fell into the court and was broken into bits', 'While this was taking place the wolf, who had transformed himself\\ninto a cock, began to swallow the seed of the pomegranate as fast\\nas he could', 'When all were gone he flew towards us, flapping his\\nwings as if to ask if we saw any more, when suddenly his eye fell\\non one which lay on the bank of the little canal that flowed\\nthrough the court; he hastened towards it, but before he could touch\\nit the seed rolled into the canal and became a fish', 'The cock\\nflung him-self in after the fish and took the shape of a pike,\\nand for two hours they chased each other up and down under the water,\\nuttering horrible cries, but we could see nothing', 'At length they\\nrose from the water in their proper forms, but darting such flames\\nof fire from their mouths that we dreaded lest the palace should\\ncatch fire', 'Soon, however, we had much greater cause for alarm,\\nas the genius, having shaken off the princess, flew towards us', 'Our fate would have been sealed if the princess, seeing our danger,\\nhad not attracted the attention of the genius to herself', \"As it was,\\nthe Sultan's beard was singed and his face scorched, the chief\\nof the eunuchs was burned to a cinder, while a spark deprived me\\nof the sight of one eye\", 'Both I and the Sultan had given up all\\nhope of a rescue, when there was a shout of \"Victory, victory', '\"\\nfrom the princess, and the genius lay at her feet a great heap\\nof ashes', 'Exhausted though she was, the princess at once ordered the little slave,\\nwho alone was uninjured, to bring her a cup of water, which she\\ntook in her hand', 'First repeating some magic words over it,\\nshe dashed it into my face saying, \"If you are only a monkey\\nby enchantment, resume the form of the man you were before', '\" \\nIn an instant I stood before her the same man I had formerly been,\\nthough having lost the sight of one eye', 'I was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she did\\nnot give me time', 'Turning to the Sultan, her father, she said,\\n\"Sire, I have gained the battle, but it has cost me dear', 'The fire\\nhas penetrated to my heart, and I have only a few moments to live', 'This would not have happened if I had only noticed the last\\npomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest', 'It was the last\\nstruggle of the genius, and up to that time I was quite safe', 'But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire,\\nand in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that I\\nknew more than he did', 'He is dead and in ashes, but my own\\ndeath is approaching fast', '\"  \"My daughter,\" cried the Sultan,\\n\"how sad is my condition', 'I am only surprised I am alive at all', 'The eunuch is consumed by the flames, and the prince whom you have\\ndelivered has lost the sight of one eye', '\"  He could say no more,\\nfor sobs choked his voice, and we all wept together', 'Suddenly the princess shrieked, \"I burn, I burn', '\" and death came\\nto free her from her torments', 'I have no words, madam, to tell you of my feelings at this\\nterrible sight', 'I would rather have remained a monkey all my\\nlife than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner', 'As for the Sultan, he was quite inconsolable, and his subjects,\\nwho had dearly loved the princess, shared his grief', 'For seven\\ndays the whole nation mourned, and then the ashes of the princess\\nwere buried with great pomp, and a superb tomb was raised over her', 'As soon as the Sultan recovered from the severe illness which\\nhad seized him after the death of the princess he sent for me\\nand plainly, though politely, informed me that my presence would\\nalways remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would instantly\\nquit his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it', 'I was,\\nof course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of me\\nI shaved my beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender', 'After wandering aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to come\\nto Bagdad and request an audience of the Commander of the Faithful', 'And that, madam, is my story', 'The other Calender then told his story', 'Story of the Third Calendar, Son of a King\\n\\n\\nMy story, said the Third Calender, is quite different from those\\nof my two friends', 'It was fate that deprived them of the sight\\nof their right eyes, but mine was lost by my own folly', 'My name is Agib, and I am the son of a king called Cassib,\\nwho reigned over a large kingdom, which had for its capital\\none of the finest seaport towns in the world', \"When I succeeded to my father's throne my first care was to visit\\nthe provinces on the mainland, and then to sail to the numerous\\nislands which lay off the shore, in order to gain the hearts\\nof my subjects\", 'These voyages gave me such a taste for sailing\\nthat I soon determined to explore more distant seas, and commanded\\na fleet of large ships to be got ready without delay', 'When they\\nwere properly fitted out I embarked on my expedition', 'For forty days wind and weather were all in our favour, but the\\nnext night a terrific storm arose, which blew us hither and thither\\nfor ten days, till the pilot confessed that he had quite lost\\nhis bearings', 'Accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead to try\\nto catch a sight of land, and reported that nothing was to be seen\\nbut the sea and sky, except a huge mass of blackness that lay astern', 'On hearing this the pilot grew white, and, beating his breast,\\nhe cried, \"Oh, sir, we are lost, lost', '\" till the ship\\'s crew trembled\\nat they knew not what', 'When he had recovered himself a little,\\nand was able to explain the cause of his terror, he replied,\\nin answer to my question, that we had drifted far out of our course,\\nand that the following day about noon we should come near that mass\\nof darkness, which, said he, is nothing but the famous Black Mountain', 'This mountain is composed of adamant, which attracts to itself\\nall the iron and nails in your ship; and as we are helplessly\\ndrawn nearer, the force of attraction will become so great that the\\niron and nails will fall out of the ships and cling to the mountain,\\nand the ships will sink to the bottom with all that are in them', 'This it is that causes the side of the mountain towards the sea to\\nappear of such a dense blackness', 'As may be supposed--continued the pilot--the mountain sides\\nare very rugged, but on the summit stands a brass dome supported\\non pillars, and bearing on top the figure of a brass horse,\\nwith a rider on his back', 'This rider wears a breastplate of lead,\\non which strange signs and figures are engraved, and it is said\\nthat as long as this statue remains on the dome, vessels will\\nnever cease to perish at the foot of the mountain', 'So saying, the pilot began to weep afresh, and the crew, fearing their\\nlast hour had come, made their wills, each one in favour of his fellow', 'At noon next day, as the pilot had foretold, we were so near to the\\nBlack Mountain that we saw all the nails and iron fly out of the ships\\nand dash themselves against the mountain with a horrible noise', 'A moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank, the crews with them', 'I alone managed to grasp a floating plank, and was driven ashore\\nby the wind, without even a scratch', 'What was my joy on finding\\nmyself at the bottom of some steps which led straight up the mountain,\\nfor there was not another inch to the right or the left where a man\\ncould set his foot', 'And, indeed, even the steps themselves were\\nso narrow and so steep that, if the lightest breeze had arisen,\\nI should certainly have been blown into the sea', 'When I reached the top I found the brass dome and the statue exactly\\nas the pilot had described, but was too wearied with all I had\\ngone through to do more than glance at them, and, flinging myself\\nunder the dome, was asleep in an instant', 'In my dreams an old man\\nappeared to me and said, \"Hearken, Agib', 'As soon as thou art awake\\ndig up the ground underfoot, and thou shalt find a bow of brass and\\nthree arrows of lead', 'Shoot the arrows at the statue, and the rider\\nshall tumble into the sea, but the horse will fall down by thy side,\\nand thou shalt bury him in the place from which thou tookest the bow\\nand arrows', 'This being done the sea will rise and cover the mountain,\\nand on it thou wilt perceive the figure of a metal man seated\\nin a boat, having an oar in each hand', 'Step on board and let\\nhim conduct thee; but if thou wouldest behold thy kingdom again,\\nsee that thou takest not the name of Allah into thy mouth', '\"\\n\\nHaving uttered these words the vision left me, and I woke,\\nmuch comforted', 'I sprang up and drew the bow and arrows out of\\nthe ground, and with the third shot the horseman fell with a great\\ncrash into the sea, which instantly began to rise, so rapidly, that I\\nhad hardly time to bury the horse before the boat approached me', 'I stepped silently in and sat down, and the metal man pushed off,\\nand rowed without stopping for nine days, after which land appeared\\non the horizon', 'I was so overcome with joy at this sight that I\\nforgot all the old man had told me, and cried out, \"Allah be praised', 'Allah be praised', '\"\\n\\nThe words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and man\\nsank from beneath me, and left me floating on the surface', 'All that day and the next night I swam and floated alternately,\\nmaking as well as I could for the land which was nearest to me', 'At last my strength began to fail, and I gave myself up for lost,\\nwhen the wind suddenly rose, and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore', 'Then, placing myself in safety, I hastily spread my clothes out to dry\\nin the sun, and flung myself on the warm ground to rest', 'Next morning I dressed myself and began to look about me', 'There seemed to be no one but myself on the island, which was covered\\nwith fruit trees and watered with streams, but seemed a long distance\\nfrom the mainland which I hoped to reach', 'Before, however, I had\\ntime to feel cast down, I saw a ship making directly for the island,\\nand not knowing whether it would contain friends or foes, I hid\\nmyself in the thick branches of a tree', 'The sailors ran the ship into a creek, where ten slaves landed,\\ncarrying spades and pickaxes', 'In the middle of the island they stopped,\\nand after digging some time, lifted up what seemed to be a trapdoor', 'They then returned to the vessel two or three times for furniture\\nand provisions, and finally were accompanied by an old man,\\nleading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age', 'They all disappeared down the trapdoor, and after remaining below\\nfor a few minutes came up again, but without the boy, and let\\ndown the trapdoor, covering it with earth as before', 'This done,\\nthey entered the ship and set sail', 'As soon as they were out of sight, I came down from my tree,\\nand went to the place where the boy had been buried', 'I dug up\\nthe earth till I reached a large stone with a ring in the centre', 'This, when removed, disclosed a flight of stone steps which led\\nto a large room richly furnished and lighted by tapers', 'On a pile\\nof cushions, covered with tapestry, sat the boy', 'He looked up,\\nstartled and frightened at the sight of a stranger in such a place,\\nand to soothe his fears, I at once spoke:  \"Be not alarmed, sir,\\nwhoever you may be', 'I am a king, and the son of a king, and will\\ndo you no hurt', 'On the contrary, perhaps I have been sent here\\nto deliver you out of this tomb, where you have been buried alive', '\"\\n\\nHearing my words, the young man recovered himself, and when I had ended,\\nhe said, \"The reasons, Prince, that have caused me to be buried\\nin this place are so strange that they cannot but surprise you', 'My father is a rich merchant, owning much land and many ships,\\nand has great dealings in precious stones, but he never ceased\\nmourning that he had no child to inherit his wealth', '\"\\n\\n\"At length one day he dreamed that the following year a son would\\nbe born to him, and when this actually happened, he consulted\\nall the wise men in the kingdom as to the future of the infant', 'One and all they said the same thing', 'I was to live happily\\ntill I was fifteen, when a terrible danger awaited me, which I\\nshould hardly escape', 'If, however, I should succeed in doing so,\\nI should live to a great old age', 'And, they added, when the statue\\nof the brass horse on the top of the mountain of adamant is thrown\\ninto the sea by Agib, the son of Cassib, then beware, for fifty days\\nlater your son shall fall by his hand', '\"\\n\\n\"This prophecy struck the heart of my father with such woe, that he\\nnever got over it, but that did not prevent him from attending\\ncarefully to my education till I attained, a short time ago,\\nmy fifteenth birthday', 'It was only yesterday that the news\\nreached him that ten days previously the statue of brass had been\\nthrown into the sea, and he at once set about hiding me in this\\nunderground chamber, which was built for the purpose, promising to\\nfetch me out when the forty days have passed', 'For myself, I have\\nno fears, as Prince Agib is not likely to come here to look for me', '\"\\n\\nI listened to his story with an inward laugh as to the absurdity of my\\never wishing to cause the death of this harmless boy, whom I hastened\\nto assure of my friendship and even of my protection; begging him,\\nin return, to convey me in his father\\'s ship to my own country', 'I need hardly say that I took special care not to inform him that I\\nwas the Agib whom he dreaded', 'The day passed in conversation on various subjects, and I found him\\na youth of ready wit and of some learning', 'I took on myself the\\nduties of a servant, held the basin and water for him when he washed,\\nprepared the dinner and set it on the table', 'He soon grew to love me,\\nand for thirty-nine days we spent as pleasant an existence as could\\nbe expected underground', 'The morning of the fortieth dawned, and the young man when he woke\\ngave thanks in an outburst of joy that the danger was passed', '\"My father may be here at any moment,\" said he, \"so make me, I pray you,\\na bath of hot water, that I may bathe, and change my clothes,\\nand be ready to receive him', '\"\\n\\nSo I fetched the water as he asked, and washed and rubbed him,\\nafter which he lay down again and slept a little', 'When he opened\\nhis eyes for the second time, he begged me to bring him a melon\\nand some sugar, that he might eat and refresh himself', 'I soon chose a fine melon out of those which remained, but could\\nfind no knife to cut it with', '\"Look in the cornice over my head,\"\\nsaid he, \"and I think you will see one', '\"  It was so high above me,\\nthat I had some difficulty in reaching it, and catching my foot in the\\ncovering of the bed, I slipped, and fell right upon the young man,\\nthe knife going straight into his heart', 'At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain', 'I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hair\\nwith sorrow', 'Then, fearing to be punished as his murderer by the\\nunhappy father, I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase,\\nand quitting the underground chamber, made everything fast as before', 'Scarcely had I finished when, looking out to sea, I saw the vessel\\nheading for the island, and, feeling that it would be useless\\nfor me to protest my innocence, I again concealed myself among\\nthe branches of a tree that grew near by', 'The old man and his slaves pushed off in a boat directly the ship\\ntouched land, and walked quickly towards the entrance to the\\nunderground chamber; but when they were near enough to see that\\nthe earth had been disturbed, they paused and changed colour', 'In silence they all went down and called to the youth by name;\\nthen for a moment I heard no more', 'Suddenly a fearful scream\\nrent the air, and the next instant the slaves came up the steps,\\ncarrying with them the body of the old man, who had fainted from sorrow', 'Laying him down at the foot of the tree in which I had taken shelter,\\nthey did their best to recover him, but it took a long while', \"When at last he revived, they left him to dig a grave, and then laying\\nthe young man's body in it, they threw in the earth\", 'This ended, the slaves brought up all the furniture that remained below,\\nand put it on the vessel, and breaking some boughs to weave\\na litter, they laid the old man on it, and carried him to the ship,\\nwhich spread its sails and stood out to sea', 'So once more I was quite alone, and for a whole month I walked daily\\nover the island, seeking for some chance of escape', 'At length\\none day it struck me that my prison had grown much larger, and that\\nthe mainland seemed to be nearer', 'My heart beat at this thought,\\nwhich was almost too good to be true', 'I watched a little longer: \\nthere was no doubt about it, and soon there was only a tiny stream\\nfor me to cross', 'Even when I was safe on the other side I had a long distance to go\\non the mud and sand before I reached dry ground, and very tired I was,\\nwhen far in front of me I caught sight of a castle of red copper,\\nwhich, at first sight, I took to be a fire', 'I made all the haste\\nI could, and after some miles of hard walking stood before it,\\nand gazed at it in astonishment, for it seemed to me the most wonderful\\nbuilding I had ever beheld', 'While I was still staring at it,\\nthere came towards me a tall old man, accompanied by ten young men,\\nall handsome, and all blind of the right eye', 'Now in its way, the spectacle of ten men walking together, all blind\\nof the right eye, is as uncommon as that of a copper castle, and I was\\nturning over in my mind what could be the meaning of this strange fact,\\nwhen they greeted me warmly, and inquired what had brought me there', 'I replied that my story was somewhat long, but that if they would\\ntake the trouble to sit down, I should be happy to tell it them', 'When I had finished, the young men begged that I would go\\nwith them to the castle, and I joyfully accepted their offer', 'We passed through what seemed to me an endless number of rooms,\\nand came at length into a large hall, furnished with ten small\\nblue sofas for the ten young men, which served as beds as well\\nas chairs, and with another sofa in the middle for the old man', 'As none of the sofas could hold more than one person, they bade me\\nplace myself on the carpet, and to ask no questions about anything I\\nshould see', 'After a little while the old man rose and brought in supper, which I\\nate heartily, for I was very hungry', 'Then one of the young men begged\\nme to repeat my story, which had struck them all with astonishment,\\nand when I had ended, the old man was bidden to \"do his duty,\"\\nas it was late, and they wished to go to bed', 'At these words\\nhe rose, and went to a closet, from which he brought out ten basins,\\nall covered with blue stuff', 'He set one before each of the young men,\\ntogether with a lighted taper', 'When the covers were taken off the basins, I saw they were filled\\nwith ashes, coal-dust, and lamp-black', 'The young men mixed these\\nall together, and smeared the whole over their heads and faces', 'They then wept and beat their breasts, crying, \"This is the fruit\\nof idleness, and of our wicked lives', '\"\\n\\nThis ceremony lasted nearly the whole night, and when it stopped\\nthey washed themselves carefully, and put on fresh clothes,\\nand lay down to sleep', 'All this while I had refrained from questions, though my curiosity\\nalmost seemed to burn a hole in me, but the following day, when we went\\nout to walk, I said to them, \"Gentlemen, I must disobey your wishes,\\nfor I can keep silence no more', 'You do not appear to lack wit,\\nyet you do such actions as none but madmen could be capable of', 'Whatever befalls me I cannot forbear asking, \"Why you daub your\\nfaces with black, and how it is you are all blind of one eye', '\" \\nBut they only answered that such questions were none of my business,\\nand that I should do well to hold my peace', '\"\\n\\nDuring that day we spoke of other things, but when night came,\\nand the same ceremony was repeated, I implored them most earnestly\\nto let me know the meaning of it all', '\"It is for your own sake,\" replied one of the young men, \"that we have\\nnot granted your request, and to preserve you from our unfortunate fate', 'If, however, you wish to share our destiny we will delay no longer', '\"\\n\\nI answered that whatever might be the consequence I wished to have\\nmy curiosity satisfied, and that I would take the result on my\\nown head', 'He then assured me that, even when I had lost my eye,\\nI should be unable to remain with them, as their number was complete,\\nand could not be added to', 'But to this I replied that, though I\\nshould be grieved to part company with such honest gentlemen,\\nI would not be turned from my resolution on that account', 'On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep and\\nkilled it, and handed me a knife, which they said I should by-and-by\\nfind useful', '\"We must sew you into this sheep-skin,\" said they,\\n\"and then leave you', 'A fowl of monstrous size, called a roc,\\nwill appear in the air, taking you to be a sheep', 'He will snatch\\nyou up and carry you into the sky, but be not alarmed, for he\\nwill bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain', 'When you are on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throw\\nit off', 'As soon as the roc sees you he will fly away from fear,\\nbut you must walk on till you come to a castle covered with\\nplates of gold, studded with jewels', 'Enter boldly at the gate,\\nwhich always stands open, but do not ask us to tell you what we\\nsaw or what befel us there, for that you will learn for yourself', 'This only we may say, that it cost us each our right eye, and has\\nimposed upon us our nightly penance', '\"\\n\\nAfter the young gentlemen had been at the trouble of sewing\\nthe sheep-skin on me they left me, and retired to the hall', 'In a few minutes the roc appeared, and bore me off to the\\ntop of the mountain in his huge claws as lightly as if I\\nhad been a feather, for this great white bird is so strong\\nthat he has been known to carry even an elephant to his nest in the hills', 'The moment my feet touched the ground I took out my knife and cut\\nthe threads that bound me, and the sight of me in my proper clothes\\nso alarmed the roc that he spread his wings and flew away', 'Then I set out to seek the castle', 'I found it after wandering about for half a day, and never could I\\nhave imagined anything so glorious', 'The gate led into a square court,\\ninto which opened a hundred doors, ninety-nine of them being\\nof rare woods and one of gold', 'Through each of these doors\\nI caught glimpses of splendid gardens or of rich storehouses', 'Entering one of the doors which was standing open I found myself\\nin a vast hall where forty young ladies, magnificently dressed,\\nand of perfect beauty, were reclining', 'As soon as they saw\\nme they rose and uttered words of welcome, and even forced me\\nto take possession of a seat that was higher than their own,\\nthough my proper place was at their feet', 'Not content with this,\\none brought me splendid garments, while another filled a basin\\nwith scented water and poured it over my hands, and the rest\\nbusied themselves with preparing refreshments', 'After I had eaten\\nand drunk of the most delicate food and rarest wines, the ladies\\ncrowded round me and begged me to tell them all my adventures', 'By the time I had finished night had fallen, and the ladies lighted\\nup the castle with such a prodigious quantity of tapers that even day\\ncould hardly have been brighter', 'We then sat down to a supper of dried\\nfruits and sweetmeats, after which some sang and others danced', 'I was so well amused that I did not notice how the time was passing,\\nbut at length one of the ladies approached and informed me it\\nwas midnight, and that, as I must be tired, she would conduct\\nme to the room that had been prepared for me', 'Then, bidding me\\ngood-night, I was left to sleep', 'I spent the next thirty-nine days in much the same way as the first,\\nbut at the close of that time the ladies appeared (as was their custom)\\nin my room one morning to inquire how I had slept, and instead\\nof looking cheerful and smiling they were in floods of tears', '\"Prince,\" said they, \"we must leave you, and never was it so hard\\nto part from any of our friends', 'Most likely we shall never see\\nyou again, but if you have sufficient self-command perhaps we may yet\\nlook forward to a meeting', '\"\\n\\n\"Ladies,\" I replied, \"what is the meaning of these strange words--\\nI pray you to tell me', '\"\\n\\n\"Know then,\" answered one of them, \"that we are all princesses--\\neach a king\\'s daughter', 'We live in this castle together, in the way\\nthat you have seen, but at the end of every year secret duties\\ncall us away for the space of forty days', 'The time has now come;\\nbut before we depart, we will leave you our keys, so that you\\nmay not lack entertainment during our absence', 'But one thing\\nwe would ask of you', 'The Golden Door, alone, forbear to open,\\nas you value your own peace, and the happiness of your life', 'That door once unlocked, we must bid you farewell for ever', '\"\\n\\nWeeping, I assured them of my prudence, and after embracing\\nme tenderly, they went their ways', 'Every day I opened two or three fresh doors, each of which\\ncontained behind it so many curious things that I had no chance\\nof feeling dull, much as I regretted the absence of the ladies', \"Sometimes it was an orchard, whose fruit far exceeded in bigness\\nany that grew in my father's garden\", 'Sometimes it was a court\\nplanted with roses, jessamine, dafeodils, hyacinths and anemones,\\nand a thousand other flowers of which I did not know the names', 'Or again, it would be an aviary, fitted with all kinds of singing birds,\\nor a treasury heaped up with precious stones; but whatever I might see,\\nall was perfect of its own sort', 'Thirty-nine days passed away more rapidly than I could have\\nconceived possible, and the following morning the princesses were\\nto return to the castle', 'But alas', 'I had explored every corner,\\nsave only the room that was shut in by the Golden Door, and I\\nhad no longer anything to amuse myself with', 'I stood before the\\nforbidden place for some time, gazing at its beauty; then a happy\\ninspiration struck me, that because I unlocked the door it was not\\nnecessary that I should enter the chamber', 'It would be enough\\nfor me to stand outside and view whatever hidden wonders might be therein', 'Thus arguing against my own conscience, I turned the key, when a smell\\nrushed out that, pleasant though it was, overcame me completely,\\nand I fell fainting across the threshold', 'Instead of being warned\\nby this accident, directly I came to myself I went for a few\\nmoments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume,\\nand then entered boldly', 'I found myself in a large, vaulted room,\\nlighted by tapers, scented with aloes and ambergris, standing in golden\\ncandle-sticks, whilst gold and silver lamps hung from the ceiling', 'Though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me, I paid them\\nscant attention, so much was I struck by a great black horse which stood\\nin one corner, the handsomest and best-shaped animal I had ever seen', 'His saddle and bridle were of massive gold, curiously wrought;\\none side of his trough was filled with clean barley and sesame,\\nand the other with rose water', 'I led the animal into the open air,\\nand then jumped on his back, shaking the reins as I did so, but as he\\nnever stirred, I touched him lightly with a switch I had picked up\\nin his stable', 'No sooner did he feel the stroke, than he spread\\nhis wings (which I had not perceived before), and flew up with me\\nstraight into the sky', 'When he had reached a prodigious height,\\nhe next darted back to earth, and alighted on the terrace belonging\\nto a castle, shaking me violently out of the saddle as he did so,\\nand giving me such a blow with his tail, that he knocked out my\\nright eye', 'Half-stunned as I was with all that had happened to me, I rose\\nto my feet, thinking as I did so of what had befallen the ten\\nyoung men, and watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds', 'I left the terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall,\\nwhich I knew to have been the one from which the roc had taken me,\\nby the ten blue sofas against the wall', 'The ten young men were not present when I first entered, but came\\nin soon after, accompanied by the old man', 'They greeted me kindly,\\nand bewailed my misfortune, though, indeed, they had expected\\nnothing less', '\"All that has happened to you,\" they said, \"we also\\nhave undergone, and we should be enjoying the same happiness still,\\nhad we not opened the Golden Door while the princesses were absent', 'You have been no wiser than we, and have suffered the same punishment', 'We would gladly receive you among us, to perform such penance\\nas we do, but we have already told you that this is impossible', 'Depart, therefore, from hence and go to the Court of Bagdad,\\nwhere you shall meet with him that can decide your destiny', '\" \\nThey told me the way I was to travel, and I left them', \"On the road I caused my beard and eyebrows to be shaved, and put\\non a Calender's habit\", 'I have had a long journey, but arrived this\\nevening in the city, where I met my brother Calenders at the gate,\\nbeing strangers like myself', 'We wondered much at one another,\\nto see we were all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisure\\nto discourse at length of our common calamities', 'We had only so much\\ntime as to come hither to implore those favours which you have been\\ngenerously pleased to grant us', 'He finished, and it was Zobeida\\'s turn to speak:  \"Go wherever\\nyou please,\"

the distance he was so tired that,\\nfinding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkled\\nwith rose water, and a cool breeze was blowing, he set his burden\\nupon the ground, and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house', 'Very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a pleasanter place;\\na delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from the open\\nwindows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamed\\nup from the hot pavement', 'Within the palace he heard some music,\\nas of many instruments cunningly played, and the melodious warble\\nof nightingales and other birds, and by this, and the appetising smell\\nof many dainty dishes of which he presently became aware, he judged\\nthat feasting and merry making were going on', 'He wondered who lived\\nin this magnificent house which he had never seen before, the street\\nin which it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass', 'To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed servants\\nwho stood at the door, and asked one of them the name of the master\\nof the mansion', '\"What,\" replied he, \"do you live in Bagdad, and not know that here\\nlives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who sailed\\nover every sea upon which the sun shines', '\"\\n\\nThe porter, who had often heard people speak of the immense wealth\\nof Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seemed\\nto be as happy as his own was miserable', 'Casting his eyes up\\nto the sky he exclaimed aloud,\\n\\n\"Consider, Mighty Creator of all things, the differences between\\nSindbad\\'s life and mine', 'Every day I suffer a thousand hardships\\nand misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barley\\nbread to keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbad\\nspends money right and left and lives upon the fat of the land', 'What has he done that you should give him this pleasant life--\\nwhat have I done to deserve so hard a fate', '\"\\n\\nSo saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with misery\\nand despair', 'Just at this moment a servant came out of the palace,\\nand taking him by the arm said, \"Come with me, the noble Sindbad,\\nmy master, wishes to speak to you', '\"\\n\\nHindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared that his\\nunguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad,\\nso he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could not\\nleave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street', 'However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of,\\nand urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porter\\nwas obliged to yield', 'He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great company\\nwas seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies', 'In the place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long white\\nbeard gave him a venerable air', 'Behind his chair stood a crowd\\nof attendants eager to minister to his wants', 'This was the famous\\nSindbad himself', 'The porter, more than ever alarmed at the sight\\nof so much magnificence, tremblingly saluted the noble company', 'Sindbad, making a sign to him to approach, caused him to be seated\\nat his right hand, and himself heaped choice morsels upon his plate,\\nand poured out for him a draught of excellent wine, and presently,\\nwhen the banquet drew to a close, spoke to him familiarly, asking his\\nname and occupation', '\"My lord,\" replied the porter, \"I am called Hindbad', '\"\\n\\n\"I am glad to see you here,\" continued Sindbad', '\"And I will answer\\nfor the rest of the company that they are equally pleased, but I wish\\nyou to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street', '\" \\nFor Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began,\\nhad heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him', 'At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging down\\nhis head, replied, \"My lord, I confess that, overcome by weariness and\\nill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray you to pardon me', '\"\\n\\n\"Oh', '\" replied Sindbad, \"do not imagine that I am so unjust as to blame\\nyou', 'On the contrary, I understand your situation and can pity you', 'Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right', 'You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and luxury\\nthat you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is far\\nindeed from being the case', 'I have only reached this happy state\\nafter having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger', '\"\\n\\n\"Yes, my noble friends,\" he continued, addressing the company,\\n\"l assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter even\\nthe most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas', 'Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven voyages,\\nand the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and land,\\nI will now give you a full and true account of them, which I think\\nyou will be well pleased to hear', '\"\\n\\nAs Sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly on account of\\nthe porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the burden\\nwhich had been left in the street should be carried by some of his\\nown servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first,\\nwhile he remained to listen to the story', 'First Voyage\\n\\n\\nI had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and being\\nyoung and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon every\\nkind of pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily take\\nto themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine,\\nand remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed,\\nI began to bethink me of how I could make the best of what still\\nremained to me', 'I sold all my household goods by public auction,\\nand joined a company of merchants who traded by sea, embarking with\\nthem at Balsora in a ship which we had fitted out between us', 'We set sail and took our course towards the East Indies by the\\nPersian Gulf, having the coast of Persia upon our left hand and upon\\nour right the shores of Arabia Felix', 'I was at first much troubled\\nby the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered my health,\\nand since that hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness', 'From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold or\\nexchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped suddenly,\\nwe found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow,\\nwhich only rose slightly above the surface of the water', 'Our sails\\nwere furled, and the captain gave permission to all who wished\\nto land for a while and amuse themselves', 'I was among the number,\\nbut when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fire\\nand sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us,\\nwe were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island,\\nwhile at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcry\\nbidding us come on board for our lives, since what we had taken\\nfor an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale', 'Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it,\\nothers sprang into the sea, but before I could save myself the whale\\nplunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving me clinging\\nto a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire', 'Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that ensued\\non board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who were\\nin the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I was\\nleft at the mercy of the waves', 'All that day I floated up and down,\\nnow beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I despaired for\\nmy life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my frail support,\\nand great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I had\\ndrifted against an island', 'The cliffs were high and steep, but luckily for me some tree-roots\\nprotruded in places, and by their aid I climbed up at last,\\nand stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I lay,\\nmore dead than alive, till the sun was high in the heavens', 'By that time I was very hungry, but after some searching I came\\nupon some eatable herbs, and a spring of clear water, and much\\nrefreshed I set out to explore the island', 'Presently I reached\\na great plain where a grazing horse was tethered, and as I stood\\nlooking at it I heard voices talking apparently underground, and in\\na moment a man appeared who asked me how I came upon the island', \"I told him my adventures, and heard in return that he was one\\nof the grooms of Mihrage, the king of the island, and that each\\nyear they came to feed their master's horses in this plain\", 'He took me to a cave where his companions were assembled, and when I\\nhad eaten of the food they set before me, they bade me think myself\\nfortunate to have come upon them when I did, since they were going\\nback to their master on the morrow, and without their aid I could\\ncertainly never have found my way to the inhabited part of the island', 'Early the next morning we accordingly set out, and when we reached\\nthe capital I was graciously received by the king, to whom I related\\nmy adventures, upon which he ordered that I should be well cared\\nfor and provided with such things as I needed', 'Being a merchant\\nI sought out men of my own profession, and particularly those\\nwho came from foreign countries, as I hoped in this way to hear\\nnews from Bagdad, and find out some means of returning thither,\\nfor the capital was situated upon the sea-shore, and visited\\nby vessels from all parts of the world', 'In the meantime I heard\\nmany curious things, and answered many questions concerning my\\nown country, for I talked willingly with all who came to me', 'Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island\\nnamed Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed\\nto be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial', 'Indeed, the sailors\\nassured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be\\nheard upon it', 'However, I saw nothing strange upon my voyage,\\nsaving some fish that were full two hundred cubits long, but were\\nfortunately more in dread of us than even we were of them, and fled\\nfrom us if we did but strike upon a board to frighten them', 'Other fishes there were only a cubit long which had heads like owls', 'One day after my return, as I went down to the quay, I saw a ship\\nwhich had just cast anchor, and was discharging her cargo,\\nwhile the merchants to whom it belonged were busily directing\\nthe removal of it to their warehouses', 'Drawing nearer I presently\\nnoticed that my own name was marked upon some of the packages,\\nand after having carefully examined them, I felt sure that they\\nwere indeed those which I had put on board our ship at Balsora', 'I then recognised the captain of the vessel, but as I was certain\\nthat he believed me to be dead, I went up to him and asked who owned\\nthe packages that I was looking at', '\"There was on board my ship,\" he replied, \"a merchant of Bagdad\\nnamed Sindbad', 'One day he and several of my other passengers\\nlanded upon what we supposed to be an island, but which was\\nreally an enormous whale floating asleep upon the waves', 'No sooner did it feel upon its back the heat of the fire which\\nhad been kindled, than it plunged into the depths of the sea', 'Several of the people who were upon it perished in the waters,\\nand among others this unlucky Sindbad', 'This merchandise is his,\\nbut I have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit of his family\\nif I should ever chance to meet with them', '\"\\n\\n\"Captain,\" said I, \"I am that Sindbad whom you believe to be dead,\\nand these are my possessions', '\"\\n\\nWhen the captain heard these words he cried out in amazement,\\n\"Lackaday', 'and what is the world coming to', 'In these days there\\nis not an honest man to be met with', 'Did I not with my own\\neyes see Sindbad drown, and now you have the audacity to tell\\nme that you are he', 'I should have taken you to be a just man,\\nand yet for the sake of obtaining that which does not belong to you,\\nyou are ready to invent this horrible falsehood', '\"\\n\\n\"Have patience, and do me the favour to hear my story,\" said I', '\"Speak then,\" replied the captain, \"I\\'m all attention', '\"\\n\\nSo I told him of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with the\\nking\\'s grooms, and how kindly I had been received at the palace', 'Very soon I began to see that I had made some impression upon him,\\nand after the arrival of some of the other merchants, who showed\\ngreat joy at once more seeing me alive, he declared that he also\\nrecognised me', 'Throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed, \"Heaven be praised\\nthat you have escaped from so great a danger', 'As to your goods,\\nI pray you take them, and dispose of them as you please', '\" \\nI thanked him, and praised his honesty, begging him to accept\\nseveral bales of merchandise in token of my gratitude, but he\\nwould take nothing', 'Of the choicest of my goods I prepared\\na present for King Mihrage, who was at first amazed, having known\\nthat I had lost my all', 'However, when I had explained to him\\nhow my bales had been miraculously restored to me, he graciously\\naccepted my gifts, and in return gave me many valuable things', 'I then took leave of him, and exchanging my merchandise for sandal\\nand aloes wood, camphor, nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger,\\nI embarked upon the same vessel and traded so successfully upon\\nour homeward voyage that I arrived in Balsora with about one\\nhundred thousand sequins', 'My family received me with as much joy\\nas I felt upon seeing them once more', 'I bought land and slaves,\\nand built a great house in which I resolved to live happily, and in\\nthe enjoyment of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings', 'Here Sindbad paused, and commanded the musicians to play again,\\nwhile the feasting continued until evening', 'When the time came\\nfor the porter to depart, Sindbad gave him a purse containing\\none hundred sequins, saying, \"Take this, Hindbad, and go home,\\nbut to-morrow come again and you shall hear more of my adventures', '\"\\n\\nThe porter retired quite overcome by so much generosity, and you\\nmay imagine that he was well received at home, where his wife and\\nchildren thanked their lucky stars that he had found such a benefactor', \"The next day Hindbad, dressed in his best, returned to the\\nvoyager's house, and was received with open arms\", 'As soon\\nas all the guests had arrived the banquet began as before,\\nand when they had feasted long and merrily, Sindbad addressed them thus:\\n\\n\"My friends, I beg that you will give me your attention while I\\nrelate the adventures of my second voyage, which you will find\\neven more astonishing than the first', '\"\\n\\n\\n\\nSecond Voyage\\n\\n\\nI had resolved, as you know, on my return from my first voyage,\\nto spend the rest of my days quietly in Bagdad, but very soon I grew\\ntired of such an idle life and longed once more to find myself upon\\nthe sea', 'I procured, therefore, such goods as were suitable for the places I\\nintended to visit, and embarked for the second time in a good ship\\nwith other merchants whom I knew to be honourable men', 'We went from\\nisland to island, often making excellent bargains, until one day we\\nlanded at a spot which, though covered with fruit trees and abounding\\nin springs of excellent water, appeared to possess neither houses\\nnor people', 'While my companions wandered here and there gathering\\nflowers and fruit I sat down in a shady place, and, having heartily\\nenjoyed the provisions and the wine I had brought with me, I\\nfell asleep, lulled by the murmur of a clear brook which flowed close by', 'How long I slept I know not, but when I opened my eyes and started\\nto my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and that\\nthe ship was gone', 'I rushed to and fro like one distracted,\\nuttering cries of despair, and when from the shore I saw the vessel\\nunder full sail just disappearing upon the horizon, I wished\\nbitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety', 'But since wishes could do me no good, I presently took courage\\nand looked about me for a means of escape', 'When I had climbed\\na tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towards\\nthe sea; but, finding nothing hopeful there, I turned landward,\\nand my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object,\\nso far off that I could not make out what it might be', 'Descending from the tree I hastily collected what remained of my\\nprovisions and set off as fast as I could go towards it', 'As I drew\\nnear it seemed to me to be a white ball of immense size and height,\\nand when I could touch it, I found it marvellously smooth and soft', 'As it was impossible to climb it--for it presented no foot-hold--\\nI walked round about it seeking some opening, but there was none', 'I counted, however, that it was at least fifty paces round', 'By this time the sun was near setting, but quite suddenly it\\nfell dark, something like a huge black cloud came swiftly over me,\\nand I saw with amazement that it was a bird of extraordinary size\\nwhich was hovering near', 'Then I remembered that I had often\\nheard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird called a roc, and it\\noccurred to me that the white object which had so puzzled me must be\\nits egg', \"Sure enough the bird settled slowly down upon it, covering it\\nwith its wings to keep it warm, and I cowered close beside the egg\\nin such a position that one of the bird's feet, which was as large\\nas the trunk of a tree, was just in front of me\", 'Taking off my turban\\nI bound myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the roc,\\nwhen it took flight next morning, would bear me away with it from\\nthe desolate island', 'And this was precisely what did happen', 'As soon as the dawn appeared the bird rose into the air carrying\\nme up and up till I could no longer see the earth, and then\\nsuddenly it descended so swiftly that I almost lost consciousness', 'When I became aware that the roc had settled and that I was once\\nagain upon solid ground, I hastily unbound my turban from its foot\\nand freed myself, and that not a moment too soon; for the bird,\\npouncing upon a huge snake, killed it with a few blows from its\\npowerful beak, and seizing it up rose into the air once more and\\nsoon disappeared from my view', 'When I had looked about me I began\\nto doubt if I had gained anything by quitting the desolate island', 'The valley in which I found myself was deep and narrow, and surrounded\\nby mountains which towered into the clouds, and were so steep\\nand rocky that there was no way of climbing up their sides', 'As I wandered about, seeking anxiously for some means of escaping\\nfrom this trap, I observed that the ground was strewed with diamonds,\\nsome of them of an astonishing size', 'This sight gave me great pleasure,\\nbut my delight was speedily damped when I saw also numbers of horrible\\nsnakes so long and so large that the smallest of them could have\\nswallowed an elephant with ease', 'Fortunately for me they seemed\\nto hide in caverns of the rocks by day, and only came out by night,\\nprobably because of their enemy the roc', 'All day long I wandered up and down the valley, and when it grew dusk\\nI crept into a little cave, and having blocked up the entrance to it\\nwith a stone, I ate part of my little store of food and lay down\\nto sleep, but all through the night the serpents crawled to and fro,\\nhissing horribly, so that I could scarcely close my eyes for terror', 'I was thankful when the morning light appeared, and when I judged\\nby the silence that the serpents had retreated to their dens I came\\ntremblingly out of my cave and wandered up and down the valley\\nonce more, kicking the diamonds contemptuously out of my path, for I\\nfelt that they were indeed vain things to a man in my situation', 'At last, overcome with weariness, I sat down upon a rock, but I had\\nhardly closed my eyes when I was startled by something which fell\\nto the ground with a thud close beside me', 'It was a huge piece of fresh meat, and as I stared at it several\\nmore pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places', \"I had\\nalways thought that the stories the sailors told of the famous\\nvalley of diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants had\\ndevised for getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers'\\ntales invented to give pleasure to the hearers, but now I perceived\\nthat they were surely true\", 'These merchants came to the valley\\nat the time when the eagles, which keep their eyries in the rocks,\\nhad hatched their young', 'The merchants then threw great lumps\\nof meat into the valley', 'These, falling with so much force upon\\nthe diamonds, were sure to take up some of the precious stones\\nwith them, when the eagles pounced upon the meat and carried it off\\nto their nests to feed their hungry broods', 'Then the merchants,\\nscaring away the parent birds with shouts and outcries, would secure\\ntheir treasures', 'Until this moment I had looked upon the valley\\nas my grave, for I had seen no possibility of getting out of it alive,\\nbut now I took courage and began to devise a means of escape', 'I began by picking up all the largest diamonds I could find and storing\\nthem carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my provisions;\\nthis I tied securely to my belt', 'I then chose the piece of meat\\nwhich seemed most suited to my purpose, and with the aid of my turban\\nbound it firmly to my back; this done I laid down upon my face\\nand awaited the coming of the eagles', 'I soon heard the flapping\\nof their mighty wings above me, and had the satisfaction of feeling\\none of them seize upon my piece of meat, and me with it, and rise\\nslowly towards his nest, into which he presently dropped me', 'Luckily for me the merchants were on the watch, and setting up their\\nusual outcries they rushed to the nest scaring away the eagle', 'Their amazement was great when they discovered me, and also\\ntheir disappointment, and with one accord they fell to abusing me\\nfor having robbed them of their usual profit', 'Addressing myself\\nto the one who seemed most aggrieved, I said:  \"I am sure, if you knew\\nall that I have suffered, you would show more kindness towards me,\\nand as for diamonds, I have enough here of the very best for you\\nand me and all your company', '\"  So saying I showed them to him', 'The others all crowded round me, wondering at my adventures\\nand admiring the device by which I had escaped from the valley,\\nand when they had led me to their camp and examined my diamonds,\\nthey assured me that in all the years that they had carried on their\\ntrade they had seen no stones to be compared with them for size\\nand beauty', 'I found that each merchant chose a particular nest, and took his\\nchance of what he might find in it', 'So I begged the one who owned\\nthe nest to which I had been carried to take as much as he would\\nof my treasure, but he contented himself with one stone, and that by\\nno means the largest, assuring me that with such a gem his fortune\\nwas made, and he need toil no more', 'I stayed with the merchants\\nseveral days, and then as they were journeying homewards I gladly\\naccompanied them', 'Our way lay across high mountains infested\\nwith frightful serpents, but we had the good luck to escape them\\nand came at last to the seashore', 'Thence we sailed to the isle\\nof Rohat where the camphor trees grow to such a size that a hundred\\nmen could shelter under one of them with ease', 'The sap flows\\nfrom an incision made high up in the tree into a vessel hung there\\nto receive it, and soon hardens into the substance called camphor,\\nbut the tree itself withers up and dies when it has been so treated', 'In this same island we saw the rhinoceros, an animal which is smaller\\nthan the elephant and larger than the buffalo', 'It has one horn\\nabout a cubit long which is solid, but has a furrow from the base\\nto the tip', 'Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man', 'The rhinoceros fights with the elephant, and transfixing him\\nwith his horn carries him off upon his head, but becoming blinded\\nwith the blood of his enemy, he falls helpless to the ground,\\nand then comes the roc, and clutches them both up in his talons\\nand takes them to feed his young', 'This doubtless astonishes you,\\nbut if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself', 'For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderful\\nthings which we saw in this island', 'Before we left I exchanged\\none of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profited\\ngreatly on our homeward way', 'At last we reached Balsora, whence I\\nhastened to Bagdad, where my first action was to bestow large sums\\nof money upon the poor, after which I settled down to enjoy tranquilly\\nthe riches I had gained with so much toil and pain', 'Having thus related the adventures of his second voyage, Sindbad again\\nbestowed a hundred sequins upon Hindbad, inviting him to come again\\non the following day and hear how he fared upon his third voyage', 'The other guests also departed to their homes, but all returned at\\nthe same hour next day, including the porter, whose former life of hard\\nwork and poverty had already begun to seem to him like a bad dream', 'Again after the feast was over did Sindbad claim the attention\\nof his guests and began the account of his third voyage', 'Third Voyage\\n\\n\\nAfter a very short time the pleasant easy life I led made me quite\\nforget the perils of my two voyages', 'Moreover, as I was still\\nin the prime of life, it pleased me better to be up and doing', 'So once more providing myself with the rarest and choicest\\nmerchandise of Bagdad, I conveyed it to Balsora, and set sail\\nwith other merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands', 'We had touched at many ports and made much profit, when one day\\nupon the open sea we were caught by a terrible wind which blew\\nus completely out of our reckoning, and lasting for several days\\nfinally drove us into harbour on a strange island', '\"I would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here,\"\\nquoth our captain', '\"This island and all adjoining it are inhabited by\\nhairy savages, who are certain to attack us, and whatever these dwarfs may\\ndo we dare not resist, since they swarm like locusts, and if one of them\\nis killed the rest will fall upon us, and speedily make an end of us', '\"\\n\\nThese words caused great consternation among all the ship\\'s company,\\nand only too soon we were to find out that the captain spoke truly', 'There appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages, not more than\\ntwo feet high and covered with reddish fur', 'Throwing themselves\\ninto the waves they surrounded our vessel', \"Chattering meanwhile\\nin a language we could not understand, and clutching at ropes\\nand gangways, they swarmed up the ship's side with such speed and\\nagility that they almost seemed to fly\", 'You may imagine the rage and terror that seized us as we watched them,\\nneither daring to hinder them nor able to speak a word to deter them\\nfrom their purpose, whatever it might be', 'Of this we were not left long\\nin doubt', 'Hoisting the sails, and cutting the cable of the anchor,\\nthey sailed our vessel to an island which lay a little further off,\\nwhere they drove us ashore; then taking possession of her, they made\\noff to the place from which they had come, leaving us helpless upon\\na shore avoided with horror by all mariners for a reason which you\\nwill soon learn', 'Turning away from the sea we wandered miserably inland, finding as we\\nwent various herbs and fruits which we ate, feeling that we might\\nas well live as long as possible though we had no hope of escape', 'Presently we saw in tho far distance what seemed to us to be a\\nsplendid palace, towards which we turned our weary steps, but when we\\nreached it we saw that it was a castle, lofty, and strongly built', 'Pushing back the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard,\\nbut upon the threshold of the great hall beyond it we paused,\\nfrozen with horror, at the sight which greeted us', 'On one\\nside lay a huge pile of bones--human bones, and on the other\\nnumberless spits for roasting', 'Overcome with despair we sank\\ntrembling to the ground, and lay there without speech or motion', 'The sun was setting when a loud noise aroused us, the door of\\nthe hall was violently burst open and a horrible giant entered', 'He was as tall as a palm tree, and perfectly black, and had one eye,\\nwhich flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead', \"His teeth were long and sharp and grinned horribly, while his lower\\nlip hung down upon his chest, and he had ears like elephant's ears,\\nwhich covered his shoulders, and nails like the claws of some\\nfierce bird\", 'At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men', 'When at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us attentively\\nwith his fearful eye', 'Presently when he had looked at us enough he\\ncame towards us, and stretching out his hand took me by the back\\nof the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling that I was\\nmere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next,\\nwhom he treated in the same fashion; at last he came to the captain,\\nand finding him the fattest of us all, he took him up in one hand\\nand stuck him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a huge fire\\nat which he presently roasted him', 'After the giant had supped he\\nlay down to sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder, while we lay\\nshivering with horror the whole night through, and when day broke\\nhe awoke and went out, leaving us in the castle', 'When we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning our\\nhorrible fate, until the hall echoed with our despairing cries', 'Though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us to\\nkill him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even if we\\nhad thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves', 'So at last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day in wandering\\nup and down the island eating such fruits as we could find,\\nand when night came we returned to the castle, having sought in vain\\nfor any other place of shelter', 'At sunset the giant returned,\\nsupped upon one of our unhappy comrades, slept and snored till dawn,\\nand then left us as before', 'Our condition seemed to us so frightful\\nthat several of my companions thought it would be better to leap\\nfrom the cliffs and perish in the waves at once, rather than await\\nso miserable an end; but I had a plan of escape which I now unfolded\\nto them, and which they at once agreed to attempt', '\"Listen, my brothers,\" I added', '\"You know that plenty of driftwood\\nlies along the shore', 'Let us make several rafts, and carry them\\nto a suitable place', 'If our plot succeeds, we can wait patiently\\nfor the chance of some passing ship which would rescue us from this\\nfatal island', 'If it fails, we must quickly take to our rafts;\\nfrail as they are, we have more chance of saving our lives with them\\nthan we have if we remain here', '\"\\n\\nAll agreed with me, and we spent the day in building rafts,\\neach capable of carrying three persons', 'At nightfall we returned\\nto the castle, and very soon in came the giant, and one more of our\\nnumber was sacrificed', 'But the time of our vengeance was at hand', \"As soon as he had finished his horrible repast he lay down to sleep\\nas before, and when we heard him begin to snore I, and nine of the\\nboldest of my comrades, rose softly, and took each a spit, which we\\nmade red-hot in the fire, and then at a given signal we plunged it\\nwith one accord into the giant's eye, completely blinding him\", 'Uttering a terrible cry, he sprang to his feet clutching in all\\ndirections to try to seize one of us, but we had all fled different\\nways as soon as the deed was done, and thrown ourselves flat upon\\nthe ground in corners where he was not likely to touch us with\\nhis feet', 'After a vain search he fumbled about till he found the door, and fled\\nout of it howling frightfully', 'As for us, when he was gone we made\\nhaste to leave the fatal castle, and, stationing ourselves beside\\nour rafts, we waited to see what would happen', 'Our idea was that if,\\nwhen the sun rose, we saw nothing of the giant, and no longer\\nheard his howls, which still came faintly through the darkness,\\ngrowing more and more distant, we should conclude that he was dead,\\nand that we might safely stay upon the island and need not risk\\nour lives upon the frail rafts', 'But alas', 'morning light showed us\\nour enemy approaching us, supported on either hand by two giants\\nnearly as large and fearful as himself, while a crowd of others\\nfollowed close upon their heels', 'Hesitating no longer we clambered\\nupon our rafts and rowed with all our might out to sea', 'The giants,\\nseeing their prey escaping them, seized up huge pieces of rock,\\nand wading into the water hurled them after us with such good\\naim that all the rafts except the one I was upon were swamped,\\nand their luckless crews drowned, without our being able to do\\nanything to help them', 'Indeed I and my two companions had all we\\ncould do to keep our own raft beyond the reach of the giants,\\nbut by dint of hard rowing we at last gained the open sea', 'Here we were at the mercy of the winds and waves, which tossed us\\nto and fro all that day and night, but the next morning we found\\nourselves near an island, upon which we gladly landed', 'There we found delicious fruits, and having satisfied our hunger we\\npresently lay down to rest upon the shore', 'Suddenly we were aroused\\nby a loud rustling noise, and starting up, saw that it was caused\\nby an immense snake which was gliding towards us over the sand', 'So swiftly it came that it had seized one of my comrades before he had\\ntime to fly, and in spite of his cries and struggles speedily crushed\\nthe life out of him in its mighty coils and proceeded to swallow him', 'By this time my other companion and I were running for our lives\\nto some place where we might hope to be safe from this new horror,\\nand seeing a tall tree we climbed up into it, having first provided\\nourselves with a store of fruit off the surrounding bushes', 'When night came I fell asleep, but only to be awakened once more\\nby the terrible snake, which after hissing horribly round the tree\\nat last reared itself up against it, and finding my sleeping comrade\\nwho was perched just below me, it swallowed him also, and crawled\\naway leaving me half dead with terror', 'When the sun rose I crept down from the tree with hardly a hope\\nof escaping the dreadful fate which had over-taken my comrades;\\nbut life is sweet, and I determined to do all I could to save myself', 'All day long I toiled with frantic haste and collected quantities\\nof dry brushwood, reeds and thorns, which I bound with faggots,\\nand making a circle of them under my tree I piled them firmly one upon\\nanother until I had a kind of tent in which I crouched like a mouse\\nin a hole when she sees the cat coming', 'You may imagine what a\\nfearful night I passed, for the snake returned eager to devour me,\\nand glided round and round my frail shelter seeking an entrance', 'Every moment I feared that it would succeed in pushing aside some\\nof the faggots, but happily for me they held together, and when it\\ngrew light my enemy retired, baffled and hungry, to his den', 'As for me I was more dead than alive', 'Shaking with fright and half\\nsuffocated by the poisonous breath of the monster, I came out of my\\ntent and crawled down to the sea, feeling that it would be better to\\nplunge from the cliffs and end my life at once than pass such another\\nnight of horror', 'But to my joy and relief I saw a ship sailing by,\\nand by shouting wildly and waving my turban I managed to attract the\\nattention of her crew', 'A boat was sent to rescue me, and very soon I found myself on board\\nsurrounded by a wondering crowd of sailors and merchants eager\\nto know by what chance I found myself in that desolate island', 'After I had told my story they regaled me with the choicest food\\nthe ship afforded, and the captain, seeing that I was in rags,\\ngenerously bestowed upon me one of his own coats', 'After sailing\\nabout for some time and touching at many ports we came at last to\\nthe island of Salahat, where sandal wood grows in great abundance', 'Here we anchored, and as I stood watching the merchants disembarking\\ntheir goods and preparing to sell or exchange them, the captain came up\\nto me and said,\\n\\n\"I have here, brother, some merchandise belonging to a passenger\\nof mine who is dead', 'Will you do me the favour to trade with it,\\nand when I meet with his heirs I shall be able to give them the money,\\nthough it will be only just that you shall have a portion for\\nyour trouble', '\"\\n\\nI consented gladly, for I did not like standing by idle', 'Whereupon he\\npointed the bales out to me, and sent for the person whose duty it\\nwas to keep a list of the goods that were upon the ship', 'When this\\nman came he asked in what name the merchandise was to be registered', '\"In the name of Sindbad the Sailor,\" replied the captain', 'At this I was greatly surprised, but looking carefully at him I\\nrecognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had made\\nmy second voyage, though he had altered much since that time', 'As for him, believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had not\\nrecognised me', '\"So, captain,\" said I, \"the merchant who owned those bales was\\ncalled Sindbad', '\"\\n\\n\"Yes,\" he replied', '\"He was so named', 'He belonged to Bagdad,\\nand joined my ship at Balsora, but by mischance he was left behind\\nupon a desert island where we had landed to fill up our water-casks,\\nand it was not until four hours later that he was missed', 'By that time the wind had freshened, and it was impossible to put\\nback for him', '\"\\n\\n\"You suppose him to have perished then', '\" said I', '\"Alas', 'yes,\" he answered', '\"Why, captain', '\"  I cried, \"look well at me', 'I am that Sindbad\\nwho fell asleep upon the island and awoke to find himself abandoned', '\"\\n\\nThe captain stared at me in amazement, but was presently convinced\\nthat I was indeed speaking the truth, and rejoiced greatly at my escape', '\"I am glad to have that piece of carelessness off my conscience\\nat any rate,\" said he', '\"Now take your goods, and the profit I\\nhave made for you upon them, and may you prosper in future', '\"\\n\\nI took them gratefully, and as we went from one island to another I\\nlaid in stores of cloves, cinnamon, and other spices', 'In one place\\nI saw a tortoise which was twenty cubits long and as many broad,\\nalso a fish that was like a cow and had skin so thick that it was\\nused to make shields', 'Another I saw that was like a camel in shape\\nand colour', 'So by degrees we came back to Balsora, and I returned\\nto Bagdad with so much money that I could not myself count it,\\nbesides treasures without end', 'I gave largely to the poor,\\nand bought much land to add to what I already possessed, and thus\\nended my third voyage', 'When Sindbad had finished his story he gave another hundred sequins\\nto Hindbad, who then departed with the other guests, but next day\\nwhen they had all reassembled, and the banquet was ended, their host\\ncontinued his adventures', 'Fourth Voyage\\n\\n\\nRich and happy as I was after my third voyage, I could not make\\nup my mind to stay at home altogether', 'My love of trading,\\nand the pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange,\\nmade me set my affairs in order, and begin my journey through some\\nof the Persian provinces, having first sent off stores of goods\\nto await my coming in the different places I intended to visit', 'I took ship at a distant seaport, and for some time all went well,\\nbut at last, being caught in a violent hurricane, our vessel became\\na total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her,\\nand many of our company perished in the waves', 'I, with a few others,\\nhad the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck,\\nfor the storm had driven us near an island, and scrambling up beyond\\nthe reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted,\\nto wait for morning', 'At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which we\\ndirected our steps', 'As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmed\\nout in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to their houses,\\nand as it were divided among our captors', 'I with five others\\nwas taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground,\\nand certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signs\\nto us to eat', 'Observing that they themselves did not touch them,\\nI was careful only to pretend to taste my portion; but my companions,\\nbeing very hungry, rashly ate up all that was set before them,\\nand very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad', 'Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a word\\nthey said, nor did they heed when I spoke to them', 'The savages\\nnow produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil,\\nof which my crazy comrades ate eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains,\\nunderstanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten us\\nspeedily for their own eating, and this was exactly what happened', 'My unlucky companions having lost their reason, felt neither\\nanxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that was offered them', 'So they were soon fat and there was an end of them, but I grew\\nleaner day by day, for I ate but little, and even that little did me\\nno good by reason of my fear of what lay before me', 'However, as I\\nwas so far from being a tempting morsel, I was allowed to wander\\nabout freely, and one day, when all the blacks had gone off upon\\nsome expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I managed\\nto escape from him and plunged into the forest, running faster\\nthe more he cried to me to come back, until I had completely\\ndistanced him', 'For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness stopped me,\\nand living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meat\\nand drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a party\\nof white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about', 'Reassured by the nature of their occupation, I advanced towards them\\nand they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came', 'My delight was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willingly\\nsatisfied their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked,\\nand captured by the blacks', '\"But these savages devour men', '\" said they', '\"How did you escape', '\"  I repeated to them what I have just told you,\\nat which they were mightily astonished', 'I stayed with them until\\nthey had collected as much pepper as they wished, and then they\\ntook me back to their own country and presented me to their king,\\nby whom I was hospitably received', 'To him also I had to relate\\nmy adventures, which surprised him much, and when I had finished he\\nordered that I should be supplied with food and raiment and treated\\nwith consideration', 'The island on which I found myself was full of people, and abounded\\nin all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of traffic\\nwent on in the capital, where I soon began to feel at home\\nand contented', 'Moreover, the king treated me with special favour,\\nand in consequence of this everyone, whether at the court or in\\nthe town, sought to make life pleasant to me', 'One thing I remarked\\nwhich I thought very strange; this was that, from the greatest\\nto the least, all men rode their horses without bridle or stirrups', 'I one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did not use them,\\nto which he replied, \"You speak to me of things of which I have never\\nbefore heard', '\"  This gave me an idea', 'I found a clever workman,\\nand made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle,\\nwhich I wadded and covered with choice leather, adorning it\\nwith rich gold embroidery', 'I then got a lock-smith to make me\\na bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern that I drew for him,\\nand when all these things were completed I presented them to the king\\nand showed him how to use them', 'When I had saddled one of his horses\\nhe mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty,\\nand to show his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts', \"After this I had to make saddles for all the principal officers\\nof the king's household, and as they all gave me rich presents I\\nsoon became very wealthy and quite an important person in the city\", 'One day the king sent for me and said, \"Sindbad, I am going to ask\\na favour of you', 'Both I and my subjects esteem you, and wish\\nyou to end your days amongst us', 'Therefore I desire that you\\nwill marry a rich and beautiful lady whom I will find for you,\\nand think no more of your own country', '\"\\n\\nAs the king\\'s will was law I accepted the charming bride he presented\\nto me, and lived happily with her', 'Nevertheless I had every intention\\nof escaping at the first opportunity, and going back to Bagdad', 'Things were thus going prosperously with me when it happened that\\nthe wife of one of my neighbours, with whom I had struck up quite\\na friendship, fell ill, and presently died', 'I went to his house\\nto offer my consolations, and found him in the depths of woe', '\"Heaven preserve you,\" said I, \"and send you a long life', '\"\\n\\n\"Alas', '\" he replied, \"what is the good of saying that when I have\\nbut an hour left to live', '\"\\n\\n\"Come, come', '\" said I, \"surely it is not so bad as all that', 'I trust that you may be spared to me for many years', '\"\\n\\n\"I hope,\" answered he, \"that your life may be long, but as for me,\\nall is finished', 'I have set my house in order, and to-day I shall\\nbe buried with my wife', 'This has been the law upon our island\\nfrom the earliest ages--the living husband goes to the grave\\nwith his dead wife, the living wife with her dead husband', 'So did our fathers, and so must we do', 'The law changes not,\\nand all must submit to it', '\"\\n\\nAs he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair began\\nto assemble', 'The body, decked in rich robes and sparkling\\nwith jewels, was laid upon an open bier, and the procession started,\\ntaking its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city,\\nthe wretched husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle,\\nfollowing mournfully', 'When the place of interment was reached the corpse was lowered,\\njust as it was, into a deep pit', 'Then the husband, bidding farewell\\nto all his friends, stretched him-self upon another bier, upon which\\nwere laid seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water, and he\\nalso was let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible cavern,\\nand then a stone was laid over the opening, and the melancholy\\ncompany wended its way back to the city', 'You may imagine that I was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings;\\nto all the others it was a thing to which they had been accustomed\\nfrom their youth up; but I was so horrified that I could not help\\ntelling the king how it struck me', '\"Sire,\" I said, \"I am more astonished than I can express to you\\nat the strange custom which exists in your dominions of burying\\nthe living with the dead', 'In all my travels I have never before\\nmet with so cruel and horrible a law', '\"\\n\\n\"What would you have, Sindbad', '\" he replied', '\"It is the law\\nfor everybody', 'I myself should be buried with the Queen if she\\nwere the first to die', '\"\\n\\n\"But, your Majesty,\" said I, \"dare I ask if this law applies\\nto foreigners also', '\"\\n\\n\"Why, yes,\" replied the king smiling, in what I could but consider\\na very heartless manner, \"they are no exception to the rule if they\\nhave married in the country', '\"\\n\\nWhen I heard this I went home much cast down, and from that time\\nforward my mind was never easy', \"If only my wife's little finger\\nached I fancied she was going to die, and sure enough before very\\nlong she fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last\", 'My dismay was great, for it seemed to me that to be buried\\nalive was even a worse fate than to be devoured by cannibals,\\nnevertheless there was no escape', 'The body of my wife, arrayed in\\nher richest robes and decked with all her jewels, was laid upon\\nthe bier', 'I followed it, and after me came a great procession,\\nheaded by the king and all his nobles, and in this order we reached\\nthe fatal mountain, which was one of a lofty chain bordering the sea', 'Here I made one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the king\\nand those who stood by, hoping to save myself even at this last moment,\\nbut it was of no avail', 'No one spoke to me, they even appeared\\nto hasten over their dreadful task, and I speedily found myself\\ndescending into the gloomy pit, with my seven loaves and pitcher\\nof water beside me', 'Almost before I reached the bottom the stone\\nwas rolled into its place above my head, and I was left to my fate', 'A feeble ray of light shone into the cavern through some chink,\\nand when I had the courage to look about me I could see that I\\nwas in a vast vault, bestrewn with bones and bodies of the dead', 'I even fancied that I heard the expiring sighs of those who,\\nlike myself, had come into this dismal place alive', 'All in vain\\ndid I shriek aloud with rage and despair, reproaching myself for\\nthe love of gain and adventure which had brought me to such a pass,\\nbut at length, growing calmer, I took up my bread and water,\\nand wrapping my face in my mantle I groped my way towards the end\\nof the cavern, where the air was fresher', 'Here I lived in darkness and misery until my provisions were exhausted,\\nbut just as I was nearly dead from starvation the rock was rolled away\\noverhead and I saw that a bier was being lowered into the cavern,\\nand that the corpse upon it was a man', 'In a moment my mind was made up,\\nthe woman who followed had nothing to expect but a lingering death;\\nI should be doing her a service if I shortened her misery', 'Therefore when she descended, already insensible from terror,\\nI was ready armed with a huge bone, one blow from which left her dead,\\nand I secured the bread and water which gave me a hope of life', 'Several times did I have recourse to this desperate expedient,\\nand I know not how long I had been a prisoner when one day I fancied\\nthat I heard something near me, which breathed loudly', 'Turning to\\nthe place from which the sound came I dimly saw a shadowy form which\\nfled at my movement, squeezing itself through a cranny in the wall', 'I pursued it as fast as I could, and found myself in a narrow crack\\namong the rocks, along which I was just able to force my way', 'I followed it for what seemed to me many miles, and at last saw\\nbefore me a glimmer of light which grew clearer every moment until\\nI emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which I cannot describe', 'When I was sure that I was not dreaming, I realised that it was\\ndoubtless some little animal which had found its way into the cavern\\nfrom the sea, and when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of escape\\nwhich I could never have discovered for myself', 'I hastily surveyed\\nmy surroundings, and saw that I was safe from all pursuit from\\nthe town', 'The mountains sloped sheer down to the sea, and there was no road\\nacross them', 'Being assured of this I returned to the cavern,\\nand amassed a rich treasure of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and jewels\\nof all kinds which strewed the ground', 'These I made up into bales,\\nand stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then waited\\nhopefully for the passing of a ship', 'I had looked out for two days,\\nhowever, before a single sail appeared, so it was with much\\ndelight that I at last saw a vessel not very far from the shore,\\nand by waving my arms and uttering loud cries succeeded in attracting\\nthe attention of her crew', 'A boat was sent off to me, and in answer\\nto the questions of the sailors as to how I came to be in such\\na plight, I replied that I had been shipwrecked two days before,\\nbut had managed to scramble ashore with the bales which I pointed\\nout to them', 'Luckily for me they believed my story, and without\\neven looking at the place where they found me, took up my bundles,\\nand rowed me back to the ship', 'Once on board, I soon saw that the\\ncaptain was too much occupied with the difficulties of navigation\\nto pay much heed to me, though he generously made me welcome,\\nand would not even accept the jewels with which I offered to pay\\nmy passage', 'Our voyage was prosperous, and after visiting many lands,\\nand collecting in each place great store of goodly merchandise,\\nI found myself at last in Bagdad once more with unheard of riches\\nof every description', 'Again I gave large sums of money to the poor,\\nand enriched all the mosques in the city, after which I gave myself up\\nto my friends and relations, with whom I passed my time in feasting\\nand merriment', 'Here Sindbad paused, and all his hearers declared that the adventures\\nof his fourth voyage had pleased them better than anything they\\nhad heard before', 'They then took their leave, followed by Hindbad,\\nwho had once more received a hundred sequins, and with the rest had\\nbeen bidden to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage', 'When the time came all were in their places, and when they had eaten\\nand drunk of all that was set before them Sindbad began his tale', 'Fifth Voyage\\n\\n\\nNot even all that I had gone through could make me contented with a\\nquiet life', 'I soon wearied of its pleasures, and longed for change\\nand adventure', 'Therefore I set out once more, but this time in a ship\\nof my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest seaport', 'I wished to be able to call at whatever port I chose, taking my own time;\\nbut as I did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo,\\nI invited several merchants of different nations to join me', 'We set sail with the first favourable wind, and after a long\\nvoyage upon the open seas we landed upon an unknown island which\\nproved to be uninhabited', \"We determined, however, to explore it,\\nbut had not gone far when we found a roc's egg, as large as the one\\nI had seen before and evidently very nearly hatched, for the beak\\nof the young bird had already pierced the shell\", 'In spite of all I\\ncould say to deter them, the merchants who were with me fell upon it\\nwith their hatchets, breaking the shell, and killing the young roc', 'Then lighting a fire upon the ground they hacked morsels from the bird,\\nand proceeded to roast them while I stood by aghast', 'Scarcely had they finished their ill-omened repast, when the air\\nabove us was darkened by two mighty shadows', 'The captain of my ship,\\nknowing by experience what this meant, cried out to us that the parent\\nbirds were coming, and urged us to get on board with all speed', 'This we did, and the sails were hoisted, but before we had made\\nany way the rocs reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it,\\nuttering frightful cries when they discovered the mangled remains\\nof their young one', 'For a moment we lost sight of them, and were\\nflattering ourselves that we had escaped, when they reappeared\\nand soared into the air directly over our vessel, and we saw\\nthat each held in its claws an immense rock ready to crush us', 'There was a moment of breathless suspense, then one bird loosed\\nits hold and the huge block of stone hurtled through the air,\\nbut thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman, who turned\\nour ship violently in another direction, it fell into the sea close\\nbeside us, cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom', 'We had hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rock\\nfell with a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel,\\nsmashing it into a thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling into\\nthe sea, passengers and crew', 'I myself went down with the rest,\\nbut had the good fortune to rise unhurt, and by holding on to a piece\\nof driftwood with one hand and swimming with the other I kept myself\\nafloat and was presently washed up by the tide on to an island', 'Its shores were steep and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threw\\nmyself down to rest upon the green turf', 'When I had somewhat recovered I began to examine the spot in which I\\nfound myself, and truly it seemed to me that I had reached a garden\\nof delights', 'There were trees everywhere, and they were laden\\nwith flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in and out\\nunder their shadow', 'When night came I slept sweetly in a cosy nook,\\nthough the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made me\\nsometimes start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wished\\nheartily that I had stayed at home at ease', 'However, the morning\\nsunlight restored my courage, and I once more wandered among\\nthe trees, but always with some anxiety as to what I might see next', 'I had penetrated some distance into the island when I saw an old\\nman bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank, and at first I\\ntook him to be some ship-wrecked mariner like myself', 'Going up\\nto him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he only nodded his head\\nat me in reply', 'I then asked what he did there, and he made signs\\nto me that he wished to get across the river to gather some fruit,\\nand seemed to beg me to carry him on my back', 'Pitying his age\\nand feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the stream I bent\\ndown that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade him get down', 'But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet (even now it\\nmakes me laugh to think of it', '), this creature who had seemed to me\\nso decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking his legs\\nround my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh choked,\\nand so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the ground', 'When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he had released\\nhis hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me revive\\nhe prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other,\\nuntil I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the trees\\nwhile he gathered and ate the choicest fruits', 'This went on all day,\\nand even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with weariness,\\nthe terrible old man held on tight to my neck, nor did he fail\\nto greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon me\\nwith his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary march\\nwith rage and bitterness in my heart', 'It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay several\\ndry gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scooping\\nout its contents and pressing into it the juice of several\\nbunches of grapes which hung from every bush', 'When it was full\\nI left it propped in the fork of a tree, and a few days later,\\ncarrying the hateful old man that way, I snatched at my gourd as I\\npassed it and had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wine\\nso good and refreshing that I even forgot my detestable burden,\\nand began to sing and caper', 'The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draught\\nhad produced and that I carried him more lightly than usual, so he\\nstretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tasted\\nits contents cautiously, then drained them to the very last drop', 'The wine was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also began\\nto sing after a fashion, and soon I had the delight of feeling\\nthe iron grip of his goblin legs unclasp, and with one vigorous\\neffort I threw him to the ground, from which he never moved again', 'I was so rejoiced to have at last got rid of this uncanny old man\\nthat I ran leaping and bounding down to the sea shore, where, by the\\ngreatest good luck, I met with some mariners who had anchored off\\nthe island to enjoy the delicious fruits, and to renew their supply\\nof water', 'They heard the story of my escape with amazement, saying, \"You fell\\ninto the hands of the Old Man of the Sea, and it is a mercy that he\\ndid not strangle you as he has everyone else upon whose shoulders\\nhe has managed to perch himself', 'This island is well known as\\nthe scene of his evil deeds, and no merchant or sailor who lands\\nupon it cares to stray far away from his comrades', '\"  After we had\\ntalked for a while they took me back with them on board their ship,\\nwhere the captain received me kindly, and we soon set sail,\\nand after several days reached a large and prosperous-looking\\ntown where all the houses were built of stone', 'Here we anchored,\\nand one of the merchants, who had been very friendly to me on\\nthe way, took me ashore with him and showed me a lodging set apart\\nfor strange merchants', 'He then provided me with a large sack,\\nand pointed out to me a party of others equipped in like manner', '\"Go with them,\" said he, \"and do as they do, but beware of losing\\nsight of them, for if you strayed your life would be in danger', '\"\\n\\nWith that he supplied me with provisions, and bade me farewell,\\nand I set out with my new companions', 'I soon learnt that the\\nobject of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts,\\nbut when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense height\\nand the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks, I did not at\\nall understand how we were to do it', 'The crowns of the cocoa-palms\\nwere all alive with monkeys, big and little, which skipped from\\none to the other with surprising agility, seeming to be curious\\nabout us and disturbed at our appearance, and I was at first\\nsurprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throw\\nthem at the lively creatures, which seemed to me quite harmless', 'But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily,\\nfor the monkeys, annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin,\\nbegan to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angry\\nand spiteful gestures, so that after very little labour our sacks\\nwere filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained', 'As soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the town,\\nwhere my friend bought my share and advised me to continue the same\\noccupation until I had earned money enough to carry me to my own country', 'This I did, and before long had amassed a considerable sum', 'Just then I heard that there was a trading ship ready to sail,\\nand taking leave of my friend I went on board, carrying with me\\na goodly store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first to the islands\\nwhere pepper grows, then to Comari where the best aloes wood\\nis found, and where men drink no wine by an unalterable law', 'Here I exchanged my nuts for pepper and good aloes wood, and went\\na-fishing for pearls with some of the other merchants, and my divers\\nwere so lucky that very soon I had an immense number, and those\\nvery large and perfect', 'With all these treasures I came joyfully\\nback to Bagdad, where I disposed of them for large sums of money,\\nof which I did not fail as before to give the tenth part to the poor,\\nand after that I rested from my labours and comforted myself with\\nall the pleasures that my riches could give me', \"Having thus ended his story, Sindbad ordered that one hundred\\nsequins should be given to Hindbad, and the guests then withdrew;\\nbut after the next day's feast he began the account of his sixth\\nvoyage as follows\", 'Sixth Voyage\\n\\n\\nIt must be a marvel to you how, after having five times met with\\nshipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune and\\nrisk fresh trouble', 'I am even surprised myself when I look back,\\nbut evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of repose\\nI prepared to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreaties\\nof my friends and relations, who did all they could to keep me\\nat home', 'Instead of going by the Persian Gulf, I travelled\\na considerable way overland, and finally embarked from a distant\\nIndian port with a captain who meant to make a long voyage', 'And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy weather which drove\\nus completely out of our course, so that for many days neither\\ncaptain nor pilot knew where we were, nor where we were going', 'When they did at last discover our position we had small ground\\nfor rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban upon the deck\\nand tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most dangerous\\nspot upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current which\\nwas at that minute sweeping us to destruction', 'It was too true', 'In spite of all the sailors could do we were driven with frightful\\nrapidity towards the foot of a mountain, which rose sheer out\\nof the sea, and our vessel was dashed to pieces upon the rocks at\\nits base, not, however, until we had managed to scramble on shore,\\ncarrying with us the most precious of our possessions', 'When we\\nhad done this the captain said to us:\\n\\n\"Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once,\\nsince from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned', '\"\\n\\nThis speech discouraged us much, and we began to lament over our\\nsad fate', 'The mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island,\\nand the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewn\\nwith the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bones\\nof the luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and we\\nshuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap', 'All around, too, lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise,\\nand treasures were heaped in every cranny of the rocks, but all\\nthese things only added to the desolation of the scene', 'It struck\\nme as a very strange thing that a river of clear fresh water,\\nwhich gushed out from the mountain not far from where we stood,\\ninstead of flowing into the sea as rivers generally do,\\nturned off sharply, and flowed out of sight under a natural archway\\nof rock, and when I went to examine it more closely I found that\\ninside the cave the walls were thick with diamonds, and rubies,\\nand masses of crystal, and the floor was strewn with ambergris', 'Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves to\\nour fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain,\\nand if a ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom', \"The first thing our captain did was to divide equally amongst us\\nall the food we possessed, and then the length of each man's life\\ndepended on the time he could make his portion last\", 'I myself could\\nlive upon very little', 'Nevertheless, by the time I had buried the last of my companions\\nmy stock of provisions was so small that I hardly thought I should\\nlive long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing,\\nwhile I regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was always\\nbringing me into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfort\\nand luxury that I had left', 'But luckily for me the fancy took me\\nto stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of sight\\nin the depths of the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me', 'This river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged again\\nat some distant spot', 'Why should I not build a raft and trust\\nmyself to its swiftly flowing waters', 'If I perished before I\\ncould reach the light of day once more I should be no worse off\\nthan I was now, for death stared me in the face, while there was\\nalways the possibility that, as I was born under a lucky star,\\nI might find myself safe and sound in some desirable land', 'I decided at any rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a stout\\nraft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to spare\\nlay strewn upon the beach', 'I then made up many packages of rubies,\\nemeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and bound\\nthem upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and then\\nI seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had fashioned\\nlaid ready to my hand, and loosed the cord which held it to the bank', 'Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the gloomy archway,\\nand I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly forward\\nby the rapid river', 'On I went as it seemed to me for many nights\\nand days', 'Once the channel became so small that I had a narrow\\nescape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that I\\ntook the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales', 'Though I only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive,\\nthe inevitable moment came when, after swallowing my last morsel\\nof food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of hunger', 'Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep,\\nand when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light of day;\\na beautiful country lay before me, and my raft, which was tied\\nto the river bank, was surrounded by friendly looking black men', 'I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to me in return, but I could\\nnot understand a word of their language', 'Feeling perfectly bewildered\\nby my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to myself in Arabic,\\n\"Close thine eyes, and while thou sleepest Heaven will change thy\\nfortune from evil to good', '\"\\n\\nOne of the natives, who understood this tongue, then came forward saying:\\n\\n\"My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and as we\\ncame to get water from the river we noticed your raft floating\\ndown it, and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore', 'We have waited for your awakening; tell us now whence you come\\nand where you were going by that dangerous way', '\"\\n\\nI replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them,\\nbut that I was starving, and would fain eat something first', 'I was soon supplied with all I needed, and having satisfied\\nmy hunger I told them faithfully all that had befallen me', 'They were lost in wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them,\\nand said that adventures so surprising must be related to their king\\nonly by the man to whom they had happened', 'So, procuring a horse,\\nthey mounted me upon it, and we set out, followed by several\\nstrong men carrying my raft just as it was upon their shoulders', 'In this order we marched into the city of Serendib, where the natives\\npresented me to their king, whom I saluted in the Indian fashion,\\nprostrating myself at his feet and kissing the ground; but the\\nmonarch bade me rise and sit beside him, asking first what was\\nmy name', '\"I am Sindbad,\" I replied, \"whom men call `the Sailor,\\' for I\\nhave voyaged much upon many seas', '\"\\n\\n\"And how come you here', '\" asked the king', 'I told my story, concealing nothing, and his surprise and delight\\nwere so great that he ordered my adventures to be written in letters\\nof gold and laid up in the archives of his kingdom', 'Presently my raft was brought in and the bales opened in his presence,\\nand the king declared that in all his treasury there were no such\\nrubies and emeralds as those which lay in great heaps before him', 'Seeing that he looked at them with interest, I ventured to say that I\\nmyself and all that I had were at his disposal, but he answered\\nme smiling:\\n\\n\"Nay, Sindbad', 'Heaven forbid that I should covet your riches;\\nI will rather add to them, for I desire that you shall not leave\\nmy kingdom without some tokens of my good will', '\"  He then commanded\\nhis officers to provide me with a suitable lodging at his expense,\\nand sent slaves to wait upon me and carry my raft and my bales to my\\nnew dwelling place', 'You may imagine that I praised his generosity\\nand gave him grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myself\\ndaily in his audience chamber, and for the rest of my time I amused\\nmyself in seeing all that was most worthy of attention in the city', 'The island of Serendib being situated on the equinoctial line,\\nthe days and nights there are of equal length', 'The chief city\\nis placed at the end of a beautiful valley, formed by the highest\\nmountain in the world, which is in the middle of the island', 'I had the curiosity to ascend to its very summit, for this was the\\nplace to which Adam was banished out of Paradise', 'Here are found\\nrubies and many precious things, and rare plants grow abundantly,\\nwith cedar trees and cocoa palms', 'On the seashore and at the mouths\\nof the rivers the divers seek for pearls, and in some valleys\\ndiamonds are plentiful', 'After many days I petitioned the king that I\\nmight return to my own country, to which he graciously consented', 'Moreover, he loaded me with rich gifts, and when I went to take\\nleave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a letter to\\nthe Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign lord, saying, \"I pray\\nyou give these to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, and assure him of\\nmy friendship', '\"\\n\\nI accepted the charge respectfully, and soon embarked upon\\nthe vessel which the king himself had chosen for me', 'The king\\'s\\nletter was written in blue characters upon a rare and precious\\nskin of yellowish colour, and these were the words of it: \\n\"The King of the Indies, before whom walk a thousand elephants,\\nwho lives in a palace, of which the roof blazes with a hundred\\nthousand rubies, and whose treasure house contains twenty thousand\\ndiamond crowns, to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid sends greeting', 'Though the offering we present to you is unworthy of your notice,\\nwe pray you to accept it as a mark of the esteem and friendship\\nwhich we cherish for you, and of which we gladly send you this token,\\nand we ask of you a like regard if you deem us worthy of it', 'Adieu, brother', '\"\\n\\nThe present consisted of a vase carved from a single ruby,\\nsix inches high and as thick as my finger; this was filled with\\nthe choicest pearls, large, and of perfect shape and lustre;\\nsecondly, a huge snake skin, with scales as large as a sequin,\\nwhich would preserve from sickness those who slept upon it', 'Then quantities of aloes wood, camphor, and pistachio-nuts; and lastly,\\na beautiful slave girl, whose robes glittered with precious stones', \"After a long and prosperous voyage we landed at Balsora, and I made\\nhaste to reach Bagdad, and taking the king's letter I presented\\nmyself at the palace gate, followed by the beautiful slave,\\nand various members of my own family, bearing the treasure\", \"As soon as I had declared my errand I was conducted into the\\npresence of the Caliph, to whom, after I had made my obeisance,\\nI gave the letter and the king's gift, and when he had examined\\nthem he demanded of me whether the Prince of Serendib was really\\nas rich and powerful as he claimed to be\", '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" I replied, again bowing humbly before him,\\n\"I can assure your Majesty that he has in no way exaggerated his wealth\\nand grandeur', 'Nothing can equal the magnificence of his palace', 'When he goes abroad his throne is prepared upon the back of an elephant,\\nand on either side of him ride his ministers, his favourites,\\nand courtiers', \"On his elephant's neck sits an officer, his golden lance\\nin his hand, and behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold,\\nat the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand\", 'A thousand\\nmen in cloth of gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants,\\ngo before him, and as the procession moves onward the officer\\nwho guides his elephant cries aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch,\\nthe powerful and valiant Sultan of the Indies, whose palace\\nis covered with a hundred thousand rubies, who possesses twenty\\nthousand diamond crowns', 'Behold a monarch greater than Solomon\\nand Mihrage in all their glory', '\\'\"\\n\\n\"Then the one who stands behind the throne answers:  `This king,\\nso great and powerful, must die, must die, must die', '\\'\"\\n\\n\"And the first takes up the chant again, `All praise to Him\\nwho lives for evermore', '\\'\"\\n\\n\"Further, my lord, in Serendib no judge is needed, for to the king\\nhimself his people come for justice', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph was well satisfied with my report', '\"From the king\\'s letter,\" said he, \"I judged that he was a wise man', 'It seems that he is worthy of his people, and his people of him', '\"\\n\\nSo saying he dismissed me with rich presents, and I returned\\nin peace to my own house', 'When Sindbad had done speaking his guests withdrew, Hindbad having\\nfirst received a hundred sequins, but all returned next day to hear\\nthe story of the seventh voyage, Sindbad thus began', 'Seventh and Last Voyage\\n\\n\\nAfter my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would go\\nto sea no more', 'I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life,\\nand I had run risks enough', 'I only wished to end my days in peace', 'One day, however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends,\\nI was told that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me,\\nand when he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence of\\nHaroun al Raschid, which I accordingly did', 'After I had saluted him,\\nthe Caliph said:\\n\\n\"I have sent for you, Sindbad, because I need your services', 'I have chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendib\\nin return for his message of friendship', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph\\'s commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" I answered, \"I am ready to do all that\\nyour Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I am\\nutterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have undergone', 'Indeed, I have made a vow never again to leave Bagdad', '\"\\n\\nWith this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures,\\nto which he listened patiently', '\"I admit,\" said he, \"that you have indeed had some extraordinary\\nexperiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doing\\nas I wish', 'You have only to go straight to Serendib and give\\nmy message, then you are free to come back and do as you will', 'But go you must; my honour and dignity demand it', '\"\\n\\nSeeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willing\\nto obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way,\\ngave me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage', 'I was soon ready to start, and taking the letter and the present I\\nembarked at Balsora, and sailed quickly and safely to Serendib', 'Here, when I had disclosed my errand, I was well received,\\nand brought into the presence of the king, who greeted me with joy', '\"Welcome, Sindbad,\" he cried', '\"I have thought of you often,\\nand rejoice to see you once more', '\"\\n\\nAfter thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed the\\nCaliph\\'s gifts', 'First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold,\\nwhich cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of crimson stuff', 'Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the finest white\\nlinen from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria', 'Then more beds\\nof different fashion, and an agate vase carved with the figure\\nof a man aiming an arrow at a lion, and finally a costly table,\\nwhich had once belonged to King Solomon', \"The King of Serendib\\nreceived with satisfaction the assurance of the Caliph's friendliness\\ntoward him, and now my task being accomplished I was anxious to depart,\\nbut it was some time before the king would think of letting me go\", 'At last, however, he dismissed me with many presents, and I lost\\nno time in going on board a ship, which sailed at once, and for four\\ndays all went well', 'On the fifth day we had the misfortune to fall\\nin with pirates, who seized our vessel, killing all who resisted,\\nand making prisoners of those who were prudent enough to submit at once,\\nof whom I was one', 'When they had despoiled us of all we possessed,\\nthey forced us to put on vile raiment, and sailing to a distant island\\nthere sold us for slaves', 'I fell into the hands of a rich merchant,\\nwho took me home with him, and clothed and fed me well, and after\\nsome days sent for me and questioned me as to what I could do', 'I answered that I was a rich merchant who had bee captured by pirates,\\nand therefore I knew no trade', '\"Tell me,\" said he, \"can you shoot with a bow', '\"\\n\\nI replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth,\\nand that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me', 'Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me with\\nhim upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which lay far\\nfrom the town', 'When we had reached the wildest part of it we stopped,\\nand my master said to me:  \"This forest swarms with elephants', 'Hide yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that pass you', 'When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me', '\"\\n\\nSo saying he gave me a supply of food, and returned to the town,\\nand I perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch', 'That night\\nI saw nothing, but just after sunrise the next morning a large\\nherd of elephants came crashing and trampling by', 'I lost no time\\nin letting fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animals\\nfell to the ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me free\\nto come down from my hiding place and run back to tell my master\\nof my success, for which I was praised and regaled with good things', 'Then we went back to the forest together and dug a mighty trench\\nin which we buried the elephant I had killed, in order that when it\\nbecame a skeleton my master might return and secure its tusks', 'For two months I hunted thus, and no day passed without my securing,\\nan elephant', 'Of course I did not always station myself in the\\nsame tree, but sometimes in one place, sometimes in another', 'One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprised\\nto see that, instead of passing the tree I was in, as they usually did,\\nthey paused, and completely surrounded it, trumpeting horribly,\\nand shaking the very ground with their heavy tread, and when I\\nsaw that their eyes were fixed upon me I was terrified, and my\\narrows dropped from my trembling hand', 'I had indeed good reason\\nfor my terror when, an instant later, the largest of the animals\\nwound his trunk round the stem of my tree, and with one mighty\\neffort tore it up by the roots, bringing me to the ground entangled\\nin its branches', 'I thought now that my last hour was surely come;\\nbut the huge creature, picking me up gently enough, set me upon\\nits back, where I clung more dead than alive, and followed\\nby the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest', 'It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feet\\nby the elephant, and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd,\\nwhich turned and trampled off in another direction, and were soon\\nhidden in the dense underwood', 'Then, recovering myself, I looked\\nabout me, and found that I was standing upon the side of a great hill,\\nstrewn as far as I could see on either hand with bones and tusks\\nof elephants', '\"This then must be the elephants\\' burying place,\"\\nI said to myself, \"and they must have brought me here that I might\\ncease to persecute them, seeing that I want nothing but their tusks,\\nand here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime', '\"\\n\\nWhereupon I turned and made for the city as fast as I could go,\\nnot seeing a single elephant by the way, which convinced me that\\nthey had retired deeper into the forest to leave the way open\\nto the Ivory Hill, and I did not know how sufficiently to admire\\ntheir sagacity', \"After a day and a night I reached my master's house,\\nand was received by him with joyful surprise\", '\"Ah', 'poor Sindbad,\" he cried, \"I was wondering what could have become\\nof you', 'When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted,\\nand the arrows lying beside it, and I feared I should never see\\nyou again', 'Pray tell me how you escaped death', '\"\\n\\nI soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went together\\nto the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find that I had told him\\nnothing but the truth', 'When we had loaded our elephant with as\\nmany tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to the city,\\nhe said:\\n\\n\"My brother--since I can no longer treat as a slave one who has\\nenriched me thus--take your liberty and may Heaven prosper you', 'I will no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants have\\nkilled numbers of our slaves every year', 'No matter what good advice\\nwe gave them, they were caught sooner or later', 'You alone have\\nescaped the wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under the\\nspecial protection of Heaven', 'Now through you the whole town will\\nbe enriched without further loss of life, therefore you shall not\\nonly receive your liberty, but I will also bestow a fortune upon you', '\"\\n\\nTo which I replied, \"Master, I thank you, and wish you all prosperity', 'For myself I only ask liberty to return to my own country', '\"\\n\\n\"It is well,\" he answered, \"the monsoon will soon bring the ivory\\nships hither, then I will send you on your way with somewhat to pay\\nyour passage', '\"\\n\\nSo I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon, and every\\nday we added to our store of ivory till all his ware-houses\\nwere overflowing with it', 'By this time the other merchants\\nknew the secret, but there was enough and to spare for all', 'When the ships at last arrived my master himself chose the one\\nin which I was to sail, and put on board for me a great store of\\nchoice provisions, also ivory in abundance, and all the costliest\\ncuriosities of the country, for which I could not thank him enough,\\nand so we parted', 'I left the ship at the first port we came to,\\nnot feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had happened to me\\nby reason of it, and having disposed of my ivory for much gold,\\nand bought many rare and costly presents, I loaded my pack animals,\\nand joined a caravan of merchants', 'Our journey was long and tedious,\\nbut I bore it patiently, reflecting that at least I had not to\\nfear tempests, nor pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perils\\nfrom which I had suffered before, and at length we reached Bagdad', 'My first care was to present myself before the Caliph, and give him\\nan account of my embassy', 'He assured me that my long absence had\\ndisquieted him much, but he had nevertheless hoped for the best', 'As to my adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement,\\ndeclaring that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulness\\nbeen well known to him', 'By his orders this story and the others I had told him were written\\nby his scribes in letters of gold, and laid up among his treasures', 'I took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honours and rewards he\\nbestowed upon me; and since that time I have rested from my labours,\\nand given myself up wholly to my family and my friends', 'Thus Sindbad ended the story of his seventh and last voyage,\\nand turning to Hindbad he added:\\n\\n\"Well, my friend, and what do you think now', 'Have you ever heard\\nof anyone who has suffered more, or had more narrow escapes than\\nI have', 'Is it not just that I should now enjoy a life of ease\\nand tranquillity', '\"\\n\\nHindbad drew near, and kissing his hand respectfully, replied, \"Sir, you\\nhave indeed known fearful perils; my troubles have been nothing compared\\nto yours', 'Moreover, the generous use you make of your wealth proves\\nthat you deserve it May you live long and happily in the enjoyment in it', '\"\\n\\nSindbad then gave him a hundred sequins, and hence-forward counted\\nhim among his friends; also he caused him to give up his profession\\nas a porter, and to eat daily at his table that he might all his\\nlife remember Sindbad the Sailor', 'The Little Hunchback\\n\\n\\nIn the kingdom of Kashgar, which is, as everybody knows,\\nsituated on the frontiers of Great Tartary, there lived long ago\\na tailor and his wife who loved each other very much', 'One day,\\nwhen the tailor was hard at work, a little hunchback came and sat at\\nthe entrance of the shop, and began to sing and play his tambourine', 'The tailor was amused with the antics of the fellow, and thought\\nhe would take him home to divert his wife', 'The hunchback having\\nagreed to his proposal, the tailor closed his shop and they set\\noff together', \"When they reached the house they found the table ready laid for supper,\\nand in a very few minutes all three were sitting before a beautiful\\nfish which the tailor's wife had cooked with her own hands\", 'But unluckily, the hunchback happened to swallow a large bone,\\nand, in spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help him,\\ndied of suffocation in an instant', 'Besides being very sorry for\\nthe poor man, the tailor and his wife were very much frightened on\\ntheir own account, for if the police came to hear of it the worthy\\ncouple ran the risk of being thrown into prison for wilful murder', 'In order to prevent this dreadful calamity they both set about\\ninventing some plan which would throw suspicion on some one else,\\nand at last they made up their minds that they could do no better than\\nselect a Jewish doctor who lived close by as the author of the crime', \"So the tailor picked up the hunchback by his head while his wife\\ntook his feet and carried him to the doctor's house\", 'Then they\\nknocked at the door, which opened straight on to a steep staircase', 'A servant soon appeared, feeling her way down the dark staircase\\nand inquired what they wanted', '\"Tell your master,\" said the tailor, \"that we have brought a very sick\\nman for him to cure; and,\" he added, holding out some money, \"give him\\nthis in advance, so that he may not feel he is wasting his time', '\" \\nThe servant remounted the stairs to give the message to the doctor,\\nand the moment she was out of sight the tailor and his wife carried\\nthe body swiftly after her, propped it up at the top of the staircase,\\nand ran home as fast as their legs could carry them', 'Now the doctor was so delighted at the news of a patient (for he\\nwas young, and had not many of them), that he was transported\\nwith joy', '\"Get a light,\" he called to the servant, \"and follow me as fast as\\nyou can', '\" and rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase', 'There he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback, and without knowing\\nwhat it was gave it such a kick that it rolled right to the bottom,\\nand very nearly dragged the doctor after it', '\"A light', 'a light', '\"\\nhe cried again, and when it was brought and he saw what he had done\\nhe was almost beside himself with terror', '\"Holy Moses', '\" he exclaimed, \"why did I not wait for the light', 'I have killed the sick man whom they brought me; and if the sacred\\nAss of Esdras does not come to my aid I am lost', 'It will not be long\\nbefore I am led to jail as a murderer', '\"\\n\\nAgitated though he was, and with reason, the doctor did not forget\\nto shut the house door, lest some passers-by might chance to see\\nwhat had happened', \"He then took up the corpse and carried it\\ninto his wife's room, nearly driving her crazy with fright\", '\"It is all over with us', '\" she wailed, \"if we cannot find some\\nmeans of getting the body out of the house', 'Once let the sun\\nrise and we can hide it no longer', 'How were you driven to commit\\nsuch a terrible crime', '\"\\n\\n\"Never mind that,\" returned the doctor, \"the thing is to find a way\\nout of it', '\"\\n\\nFor a long while the doctor and his wife continued to turn over\\nin their minds a way of escape, but could not find any that seemed\\ngood enough', 'At last the doctor gave it up altogether and resigned\\nhimself to bear the penalty of his misfortune', 'But his wife, who had twice his brains, suddenly exclaimed, \"I have\\nthought of something', 'Let us carry the body on the roof of the house\\nand lower it down the chimney of our neighbour the Mussulman', '\" \\nNow this Mussulman was employed by the Sultan, and furnished\\nhis table with oil and butter', 'Part of his house was occupied\\nby a great storeroom, where rats and mice held high revel', \"The doctor jumped at his wife's plan, and they took up the hunchback,\\nand passing cords under his armpits they let him down into the\\npurveyor's bed-room so gently that he really seemed to be leaning\\nagainst the wall\", 'When they felt he was touching the ground they\\ndrew up the cords and left him', 'Scarcely had they got back to their own house when the purveyor\\nentered his room', 'He had spent the evening at a wedding feast,\\nand had a lantern in his hand', 'In the dim light it cast he was\\nastonished to see a man standing in his chimney, but being naturally\\ncourageous he seized a stick and made straight for the supposed thief', '\"Ah', '\" he cried, \"so it is you, and not the rats and mice, who steal\\nmy butter', \"I'll take care that you don't want to come back\", '\"\\n\\nSo saying he struck him several hard blows', 'The corpse fell on\\nthe floor, but the man only redoubled his blows, till at length it\\noccurred to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and make\\nno resistance', 'Then, finding he was quite dead, a cold fear took\\npossession of him', '\"Wretch that I am,\" said he, \"I have murdered\\na man', 'Ah, my revenge has gone too far', 'Without tho help of Allah\\nI am undone', 'Cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin', '\" \\nAnd already he felt the rope round his neck', 'But when he had got over the first shock he began to think of some\\nway out of the difficulty, and seizing the hunchback in his arms he\\ncarried him out into the street, and leaning him against the wall\\nof a shop he stole back to his own house, without once looking\\nbehind him', 'A few minutes before the sun rose, a rich Christian merchant,\\nwho supplied the palace with all sorts of necessaries, left his house,\\nafter a night of feasting, to go to the bath', 'Though he was\\nvery drunk, he was yet sober enough to know that the dawn was at hand,\\nand that all good Mussulmen would shortly be going to prayer', 'So he hastened his steps lest he should meet some one on his way\\nto the mosque, who, seeing his condition, would send him to prison\\nas a drunkard', 'In his haste he jostled against the hunchback,\\nwho fell heavily upon him, and the merchant, thinking he was being\\nattacked by a thief, knocked him down with one blow of his fist', 'He then called loudly for help, beating the fallen man all\\nthe while', 'The chief policeman of the quarter came running up, and found\\na Christian ill-treating a Mussulman', '\"What are you doing', '\"\\nhe asked indignantly', '\"He tried to rob me,\" replied the merchant, \"and very nearly\\nchoked me', '\"\\n\\n\"Well, you have had your revenge,\" said the man, catching hold\\nof his arm', '\"Come, be off with you', '\"\\n\\nAs he spoke he held out his hand to the hunchback to help him up,\\nbut the hunchback never moved', '\"Oho', '\" he went on, looking closer,\\n\"so this is the way a Christian has the impudence to treat\\na Mussulman', '\" and seizing the merchant in a firm grasp he took\\nhim to the inspector of police, who threw him into prison till\\nthe judge should be out of bed and ready to attend to his case', 'All this brought the merchant to his senses, but the more he thought\\nof it the less he could understand how the hunchback could have died\\nmerely from the blows he had received', 'The merchant was still pondering on this subject when he was\\nsummoned before the chief of police and questioned about his crime,\\nwhich he could not deny', \"As the hunchback was one of the Sultan's\\nprivate jesters, the chief of police resolved to defer sentence\\nof death until he had consulted his master\", 'He went to the palace\\nto demand an audience, and told his story to the Sultan, who only answered,\\n\\n\"There is no pardon for a Christian who kills a Mussulman', 'Do your duty', '\"\\n\\nSo the chief of police ordered a gallows to be erected, and sent\\ncriers to proclaim in every street in the city that a Christian\\nwas to be hanged that day for having killed a Mussulman', 'When all was ready the merchant was brought from prison and led\\nto the foot of the gallows', 'The executioner knotted the cord firmly\\nround the unfortunate man\\'s neck and was just about to swing him\\ninto the air, when the Sultan\\'s purveyor dashed through the crowd,\\nand cried, panting, to the hangman,\\n\\n\"Stop, stop, don\\'t be in such a hurry', 'It was not he who did\\nthe murder, it was I', '\"\\n\\nThe chief of police, who was present to see that everything was\\nin order, put several questions to the purveyor, who told him the\\nwhole story of the death of the hunchback, and how he had carried\\nthe body to the place where it had been found by the Christian merchant', '\"You are going,\" he said to the chief of police, \"to kill an\\ninnocent man, for it is impossible that he should have murdered\\na creature who was dead already', 'It is bad enough for me\\nto have slain a Mussulman without having it on my conscience\\nthat a Christian who is guiltless should suffer through my fault', '\"\\n\\nNow the purveyor\\'s speech had been made in a loud voice, and was\\nheard by all the crowd, and even if he had wished it, the chief\\nof police could not have escaped setting the merchant free', '\"Loose the cords from the Christian\\'s neck,\" he commanded,\\nturning to the executioner, \"and hang this man in his place,\\nseeing that by his own confession he is the murderer', '\"\\n\\nThe hangman did as he was bid, and was tying the cord firmly,\\nwhen he was stopped by the voice of the Jewish doctor beseeching\\nhim to pause, for he had something very important to say', 'When he had fought his way through the crowd and reached the chief\\nof police,\\n\\n\"Worshipful sir,\" he began, \"this Mussulman whom you desire\\nto hang is unworthy of death; I alone am guilty', 'Last night\\na man and a woman who were strangers to me knocked at my door,\\nbringing with them a patient for me to cure', 'The servant opened it,\\nbut having no light was hardly able to make out their faces,\\nthough she readily agreed to wake me and to hand me the fee for\\nmy services', 'While she was telling me her story they seem to have\\ncarried the sick man to the top of the staircase and then left\\nhim there', 'I jumped up in a hurry without waiting for a lantern,\\nand in the darkness I fell against something, which tumbled headlong\\ndown the stairs and never stopped till it reached the bottom', 'When I examined the body I found it was quite dead, and the corpse\\nwas that of a hunchback Mussulman', 'Terrified at what we had done,\\nmy wife and I took the body on the roof and let it down the chimney\\nof our neighbour the purveyor, whom you were just about to hang', 'The purveyor, finding him in his room, naturally thought he was a thief,\\nand struck him such a blow that the man fell down and lay motionless\\non the floor', 'Stooping to examine him, and finding him stone dead,\\nthe purveyor supposed that the man had died from the blow he\\nhad received; but of course this was a mistake, as you will see from\\nmy account, and I only am the murderer; and although I am innocent\\nof any wish to commit a crime, I must suffer

hearing the declaration of the Jewish doctor, the chief of police\\ncommanded that he should be led to the gallows, and the Sultan\\'s\\npurveyor go free', \"The cord was placed round the Jew's

the death of the hunchback had given rise', '\"Loosen the Jewish doctor,\" said he to the hangman, \"and string up\\nthe tailor instead, since he has made confession of his crime', 'Really, one cannot deny that this is a very singular story,\\nand it deserves to be written in letters of gold', '\"\\n\\nThe executioner speedily untied the knots which confined the doctor,\\nand was passing the cord round the neck of the tailor, when the\\nSultan of Kashgar, who had missed his jester, happened to make\\ninquiry of his officers as to what had become of him', '\"Sire,\" replied they, \"the hunchback having drunk more than was\\ngood for him, escaped from the palace and was seen wandering about\\nthe town, where this morning he was found dead', 'A man was arrested\\nfor having caused his

once again', 'The usher hastened on his errand,\\nbut was only just in time, for the tailor was positively swinging\\nin the air, when his voice fell upon the silence of the crowd,\\ncommanding the hangman to cut down the body', \"The hangman,\\nrecognising the usher as one of the king's servants, cut down\\nthe tailor, and the usher, seeing the man was safe, sought the chief\\nof police and

dead\\nhunchback on their shoulders', 'When the procession reached the palace the chief of police prostrated\\nhimself at the feet of the Sultan, and related all that he knew of\\nthe matter', 'The Sultan was so much struck by the circumstances that he\\nordered his private historian to write down an exact account of what\\nhad passed, so that in the years to come the miraculous escape of the\\nfour men who had thought themselves murderers might never be forgotten', \"The Sultan asked everybody concerned in the hunchback's affair\\nto tell him their stories\", 'Among others was a

drachmas to be divided amongst us, which made one hundred\\nfor each son', 'Alnaschar, who had never possessed so much money\\nin his life, was quite puzzled to know what to do with it', 'After reflecting upon the matter for some time he decided to lay it\\nout on glasses, bottles, and things of that sort, which he would\\nbuy from a wholesale merchant', 'Having bought his stock he next\\nproceeded to look out for a small shop in a good position, where he\\nsat down at the open door, his wares being piled up in an uncovered\\nbasket in front of him, waiting for a customer among the passers-by', 'In this attitude he remained seated, his eyes fixed on the basket,\\nbut his thoughts far away', 'Unknown to himself he began to talk\\nout loud, and a tailor, whose shop was next

other precious stones', 'At last, having all the wealth that heart can desire, I will buy\\na beautiful country house, with horses and slaves, and then I will\\nlead a merry life and entertain my friends', 'At my feasts I will\\nsend for musicians and dancers from the neighbouring town to amuse\\nmy guests', \"In spite of my riches I shall not, however, give up trade\\ntill I have amassed a

over\\nhis last adventure, he put his gold into a long and narrow purse,\\nwhich he could easily carry in his belt', 'During this time the old\\nwoman was busy over her prayers, and when she had finished she\\ncame and prostrated herself twice before my brother, and then\\nrising called down endless blessings on his head', 'Observing her\\nshabby clothes, my brother thought that her gratitude was in reality\\na hint that he should give her some money to buy some new ones,\\nso he held out two pieces of gold', 'The old woman started back\\nin surprise as if she had received an insult', '\"Good heavens', '\"\\nshe exclaimed, \"what is the meaning of this', 'Is it possible that you\\ntake me, my lord, for one of those miserable creatures who force\\ntheir way into houses to beg for alms', 'Take back your money', 'I am thankful to say I do not need it, for I belong to a beautiful\\nlady who is very rich and gives me everything I want', '\"\\n\\nMy brother was not clever enough to

had found so easily both a\\nfortune and a beautiful wife, my brother asked no more questions,\\nbut concealing his purse, with the money the lady had given him,\\nin the folds of his dress, he set out joyfully with his guide', 'They walked for some distance till the old woman stopped at a\\nlarge house, where she knocked', 'The door was opened by a young\\nGreek slave, and the old woman led my brother across a well-paved\\ncourt into a well-furnished hall', 'Here she left him to inform\\nher mistress of his presence, and as the day was hot he flung\\nhimself on a pile of cushions and took off his heavy turban', 'In a few minutes there entered a lady, and my brother perceived at\\nthe first glance that she was even more beautiful and more richly\\ndressed than he had expected', 'He rose from his seat, but the lady\\nsigned to him to sit down again and placed herself beside him', 'After the usual compliments had passed between them she said,\\n\"We are not comfortable here, let us go into another room,\"\\nand passing into a smaller chamber, apparently communicating\\nwith no other, she continued to talk to him for some time', 'Then rising hastily she left him, saying, \"Stay where you are,\\nI will come back in a moment', '\"\\n\\nHe waited as he was told, but instead of the lady there entered a huge\\nblack slave with a sword in his hand', 'Approaching my brother with\\nan angry countenance he exclaimed, \"What business have you here', '\" \\nHis voice and manner were so terrific that Alnaschar had not strength\\nto reply, and allowed his gold to be taken from him, and even\\nsabre cuts to be inflicted on him without making any resistance', 'As soon as he was let go, he sank on the ground powerless to move,\\nthough he still had possession of his senses', 'Thinking he was dead,\\nthe black ordered the Greek slave to bring him some salt, and between\\nthem they rubbed it into his wounds, thus giving him acute agony,\\nthough he had the presence of mind to give no sign of life', 'They then left him, and their place was taken by the old woman,\\nwho dragged him to a trapdoor and threw him down into a vault filled\\nwith the bodies of murdered men', 'At first the violence of his fall caused him to lose consciousness,\\nbut luckily the salt which had been rubbed into his wounds had by\\nits smarting preserved his life, and little by little he regained\\nhis strength', 'At the end of two days he lifted the trapdoor\\nduring the night and hid himself in the courtyard till daybreak,\\nwhen he saw the old woman leave the house in search of more prey', 'Luckily she did not observe him, and when she was out of sight he\\nstole from this nest of assassins and took refuge in my house', 'I dressed his wounds and tended him carefully, and when a month\\nhad passed he was as well as ever', 'His one thought was how to\\nbe revenged on that wicked old hag, and for this purpose he had\\na purse made large enough to contain five hundred gold pieces,\\nbut filled it instead with bits of glass', 'This he tied round\\nhim with his sash, and, disguising himself as an old woman,\\nhe took a sabre, which he hid under his dress', 'One morning as he was hobbling through the streets he met his\\nold enemy prowling to see if she could find anyone to decoy', 'He went up to her and, imitating the voice of a woman, he said,\\n\"Do you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me', 'I have just come from Persia and have brought with me five hundred\\ngold pieces, and I am anxious to see if they are the proper weight', '\"\\n\\n\"Good woman,\" replied the old hag, \"you could not have asked\\nanyone better', 'My son is a money-changer, and if you will follow\\nme he will weigh them for you himself', 'Only we must be quick or he\\nwill have gone to his shop', '\"  So saying she led the way to the same\\nhouse as before, and the door was opened by the same Greek slave', 'Again my brother was left in the hall, and the pretended son\\nappeared under the form of the black slave', '\"Miserable crone,\"\\nhe said to my brother, \"get up and come with me,\" and turned\\nto lead the way to the place of murder', 'Alnaschar rose too,\\nand drawing the sabre from under his dress dealt the black such\\na blow on his neck that his head was severed from his body', 'My brother picked up the head with one hand, and seizing the body\\nwith the other dragged it to the vault, when he threw it in and sent\\nthe head after it', 'The Greek slave, supposing that all had passed\\nas usual, shortly arrived with the basin of salt, but when she\\nbeheld Alnaschar with the sabre in his hand she let the basin fall\\nand turned to fly', 'My brother, however, was too quick for her,\\nand in another instant her head was rolling from her shoulders', 'The noise brought the old woman running to see what was the matter,\\nand he seized her before she had time to escape', '\"Wretch', '\" he cried,\\n\"do you know me', '\"\\n\\n\"Who are you, my lord', '\" she replied trembling all over', '\"I have\\nnever seen you before', '\"\\n\\n\"I am he whose house you entered to offer your hypocritical prayers', \"Don't you remember now\", '\"\\n\\nShe flung herself on her knees to implore mercy, but he cut her\\nin four pieces', 'There remained only the lady, who was quite ignorant of all that\\nwas taking place around her', 'He sought her through the house,\\nand when at last he found her, she nearly fainted with terror at\\nthe sight of him', 'She begged hard for life, which he was generous\\nenough to give her, but he bade her to tell him how she had got into\\npartnership with the abominable creatures he had just put to death', '\"I was once,\" replied she, \"the wife of an honest merchant, and that\\nold woman, whose wickedness I did not know, used occasionally to\\nvisit me', '\"Madam,\" she said to me one day, \"we have a grand wedding\\nat our house to-day', 'If you would do us the honour to be present,\\nI am sure you would enjoy yourself', '\"  I allowed myself to be persuaded,\\nput on my richest dress, and took a purse with a hundred pieces of gold', 'Once inside the doors I was kept by force by that dreadful black,\\nand it is now three years that I have been here, to my great grief', '\"\\n\\n\"That horrible black must have amassed great wealth,\" remarked my brother', '\"Such wealth,\" returned she, \"that if you succeed in carrying it\\nall away it will make you rich for ever', 'Come and let us see\\nhow much there is', '\"\\n\\nShe led Alnaschar into a chamber filled with coffers packed with gold,\\nwhich he gazed at with an admiration he was powerless to conceal', '\"Go,\"\\nshe said, \"and bring men to carry them away', '\"\\n\\nMy brother did not wait to be told twice, and hurried out into\\nthe streets, where he soon collected ten men', 'They all came back\\nto the house, but what was his surprise to find the door open,\\nand the room with the chests of gold quite empty', 'The lady had been\\ncleverer than himself, and had made the best use of her time', 'However,\\nhe tried to console himself by removing all the beautiful furniture,\\nwhich more than made up for the five hundred gold pieces he had lost', 'Unluckily, on leaving the house, he forgot to lock the door,\\nand the neighbours, finding the place empty, informed the police,\\nwho next morning arrested Alnaschar as a thief', 'My brother tried to bribe\\nthem to let him off, but far from listening to him they tied his hands,\\nand forced him to walk between them to the presence of the judge', 'When they had explained to the official the cause of complaint,\\nhe asked Alnaschar where he had obtained all the furniture that he\\nhad taken to his house the day before', '\"Sir,\" replied Alnaschar, \"I am ready to tell you the whole story,\\nbut give, I pray you, your word, that I shall run no risk of punishment', '\"\\n\\n\"That I promise,\" said the judge', 'So my brother began at the\\nbeginning and related all his adventures, and how he had avenged\\nhimself on those who had betrayed him', 'As to the furniture,\\nhe entreated the judge at least to allow him to keep part to make\\nup for the five hundred pieces of gold which had been stolen from him', 'The judge, however, would say nothing about this, and lost no time\\nin sending men to fetch away all that Alnaschar had taken from\\nthe house', 'When everything had been moved and placed under his roof\\nhe ordered my brother to leave the town and never more to enter it\\non peril of his life, fearing that if he returned he might seek\\njustice from the Caliph', 'Alnaschar obeyed, and was on his way\\nto a neighbouring city when he fell in with a band of robbers,\\nwho stripped him of his clothes and left him naked by the roadside', 'Hearing of his plight, I hurried after him to console him for\\nhis misfortunes, and to dress him in my best robe', 'I then brought\\nhim back disguised, under

he soon lost it all,\\nand was driven to beg', 'As he had a smooth tongue and good manners,\\nhe really did very well in his new profession, and he devoted\\nhimself specially to making friends with the servants in big houses,\\nso as to gain access to their masters', 'One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with a crowd of servants\\nlounging in the courtyard', 'He thought that from the appearance\\nof the house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he entered\\nand inquired to whom it belonged', '\"My good man, where do you come from', '\" replied the servant', '\"Can\\'t you\\nsee for yourself that it can belong to nobody but a Barmecide', '\"\\nfor the Barmecides were famed for their liberality and generosity', 'My brother, hearing this, asked the porters, of whom there were several,\\nif they would give him alms', 'They did not refuse, but told him\\npolitely to go in, and speak to the master himself', 'My brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the building,\\nwhich was so large that it took him some time to reach the apartments\\nof the Barmecide', 'At last, in a room richly decorated with paintings,\\nhe saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting on a sofa,\\nwho received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldened\\nto make his petition', '\"My lord,\" he said, \"you behold in me a poor man who only lives\\nby the help of persons as rich and as generous as you', '\"\\n\\nBefore he could proceed further, he was stopped by the astonishment\\nshown by the Barmecide', '\"Is it possible,\" he cried, \"that while I\\nam in Bagdad, a man like you should be starving', 'That is a state\\nof things that must at once be put an end to', 'Never shall it be said\\nthat I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you, on your part,\\nwill never abandon me', '\"\\n\\n\"My lord,\" answered my brother, \"I swear that I have not broken\\nmy fast this whole day', '\"\\n\\n\"What, you are dying of hunger', '\" exclaimed the Barmecide', '\"Here, slave; bring water, that we may wash our hands before meat', '\" \\nNo slave appeared, but my brother remarked that the Barmecide did\\nnot fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over them', 'Then he said to my brother, \"Why don\\'t you wash your hands too', '\"\\nand Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the part of the\\nBarmecide (though he could see none himself), drew near, and imitated\\nhis motion', 'When the Barmecide had done rubbing his hands, he raised his voice,\\nand cried, \"Set food before us at once, we are very hungry', '\" \\nNo food was brought, but the Barmecide pretended to help himself\\nfrom a dish, and carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so,\\n\"Eat, my friend, eat, I entreat', 'Help yourself as freely as if\\nyou were at home', 'For a starving man, you seem to have a very\\nsmall appetite', '\"\\n\\n\"Excuse me, my lord,\" replied Schacabac, imitating his gestures\\nas before, \"I really am not losing time, and I do full justice\\nto the repast', '\"\\n\\n\"How do you like this bread', '\" asked the Barmecide', '\"I find it\\nparticularly good myself', '\"\\n\\n\"Oh, my lord,\" answered my brother, who beheld neither meat nor bread,\\n\"never have I tasted anything so delicious', '\"\\n\\n\"Eat as much as you want,\" said the Barmecide', '\"I bought\\nthe woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold,\\nso that I might never be without it', '\"\\n\\nAfter ordering a variety of dishes (which never came) to be placed on\\nthe table, and discussing the merits of each one, the Barmecide declared\\nthat having dined so well, they would now proceed to take their wine', 'To this my brother at first objected, declaring that it was forbidden;\\nbut on the Barmecide insisting that it was out of the question\\nthat he should drink by himself, he consented to take a little', 'The Barmecide, however, pretended to fill their glasses so often,\\nthat my brother feigned that the wine had gone into his head,\\nand struck the Barmecide such a blow on the head, that he fell to\\nthe ground', 'Indeed, he raised his hand to strike him a second time,\\nwhen the Barmecide cried out that he was mad, upon which my brother\\ncontrolled himself, and apologised and protested that it was\\nall the fault of the wine he had drunk', 'At this the Barmecide,\\ninstead of being angry, began to laugh, and embraced him heartily', '\"I have long been seeking,\" he exclaimed, \"a man of your description,\\nand henceforth my house shall be yours', 'You have had the good\\ngrace to fall in with my humour, and to pretend to eat and to drink\\nwhen nothing was there', 'Now you shall be rewarded by a really\\ngood supper', '\"\\n\\nThen he clapped his hands, and all the dishes were brought that\\nthey had tasted in imagination before and during the repast,\\nslaves sang and played on various instruments', 'All the while\\nSchacabac was treated by the Barmecide as a familiar friend,\\nand dressed in a garment out of his own wardrobe', 'Twenty years passed by, and my brother was still living with\\nthe Barmecide, looking after his house, and managing his affairs', 'At the end of that time his generous benefactor died without heirs,\\nso all his possessions went to the prince', 'They even despoiled\\nmy brother of those that rightly belonged to him, and he,\\nnow as

and the pilgrims were taken prisoners', 'My brother\\nbecame the slave of a man who beat him daily, hoping to drive him\\nto offer a ransom, although, as Schacabac pointed out, it was\\nquite useless

chance', 'A passing caravan, on its way to Bagdad,\\ntold me where he was to be found, and I hurried to his rescue,\\nand brought him in a deplorable condition back to the town', '\"This,\"--continued the barber,--\"is the tale I related\\nto the Caliph, who, when I had finished, burst into fits of laughter', '\"\\n\\n\"Well were you called `the Silent,\\'\" said he; \"no name was ever\\nbetter deserved', 'But for reasons of my own, which it is not necessary\\nto mention, I desire you to leave the town, and never to come back', '\"\\n\\n\"I had of course no choice but to obey, and travelled about for several\\nyears until I heard of the death of the Caliph, when I hastily\\nreturned to Bagdad, only to find that all my brothers were dead', 'It was at this time that I rendered to the young

me', 'I sought him\\nlong from place to place, but it was only to-day, when I expected\\nit least, that I came across him, as much irritated with me as ever\"--\\nSo saying the tailor went on to relate the story of the lame man\\nand the barber, which has already been told', '\"When the barber,\" he continued, \"had finished his tale, we came\\nto the conclusion that the young man had been right, when he\\nhad accused him of being a great chatter-box', 'However, we wished\\nto keep him with us, and share our feast, and we remained at table\\ntill the hour of afternoon prayer', 'Then the company broke up,\\nand I went back to work in my shop', '\"\\n\\n\"It was during this interval that the little hunchback, half drunk\\nalready, presented himself before me, singing and playing on his drum', 'I took him home, to amuse my wife, and she invited him to supper', 'While eating some fish, a bone got into his throat, and in spite\\nof all we could do, he died shortly', 'It was all so sudden that we\\nlost our heads, and in order to divert suspicion from ourselves,\\nwe carried the body to the house of a Jewish physician', 'He placed\\nit in the chamber of the purveyor, and the purveyor propped it up in\\nthe street, where it was thought to have been killed by the merchant', '\"\\n\\n\"This, Sire, is the story which I was obliged to tell to satisfy\\nyour highness', 'It is now for you to say if we deserve mercy\\nor punishment; life or death', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan of Kashgar listened with an air of pleasure which filled\\nthe tailor and his friends with hope', '\"I must confess,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"that I am much more interested in the stories of the barber and\\nhis brothers, and of the lame man, than in that of my own jester', 'But before I allow you all four to return to your own homes, and have\\nthe corpse of the hunchback properly buried, I should like to see\\nthis barber who has earned your pardon', 'And as he is in this town,\\nlet an usher go with you at once in search of him', '\"\\n\\nThe usher and the tailor soon returned, bringing with them an old man\\nwho must have been at least ninety years of age', '\"O Silent One,\"\\nsaid the Sultan, \"I am told that you know many strange stories', 'Will you tell some of them to me', '\"\\n\\n\"Never mind my stories for the present,\" replied the barber,\\n\"but will your Highness graciously be pleased to explain why this Jew,\\nthis Christian, and this Mussulman, as well as this dead body,\\nare all here', '\"\\n\\n\"What business is that of yours', '\" asked the Sultan with a smile;\\nbut seeing that the barber had some reasons for his question,\\nhe commanded that the tale of the hunch-back should be told him', '\"It is certainly most surprising,\" cried he, when he had heard it all,\\n\"but I should like to examine the body', '\"  He then knelt down, and took\\nthe head on his knees, looking at it attentively', 'Suddenly he burst\\ninto such loud laughter that he fell right backwards, and when he\\nhad recovered himself enough to speak, he turned to the Sultan', '\"The man is no more dead than I am,\" he said; \"watch me', '\"  As he\\nspoke he drew a small case of medicines from his pocket and rubbed\\nthe neck of the hunchback with some ointment made of balsam', \"Next he\\nopened the dead man's mouth, and by the help of a pair of pincers\\ndrew the bone from his throat\", 'At this the hunch-back sneezed,\\nstretched himself and opened his eyes', 'The Sultan and all those who saw this operation did not know which\\nto admire most, the constitution of the hunchback who had apparently\\nbeen dead for a whole night and most of one day, or the skill of\\nthe barber, whom everyone now began to look upon as a great man', \"His Highness desired that the history of the hunchback should be\\nwritten down, and placed in the archives beside that of the barber,\\nso that they might be associated in people's minds to the end of time\", 'And he did not stop there; for in order to wipe out the memory of\\nwhat they had undergone, he commanded that the tailor, the doctor,\\nthe purveyor and the merchant, should each be clothed in his presence\\nwith a robe from his own wardrobe before they returned home', 'As for the barber, he bestowed on him a large pension, and kept him\\nnear his own person', \"The Adventures of Prince Camaralzaman and the Princess Badoura\\n\\n\\nSome twenty days' sail from the coast of Persia lies the isle of the\\nchildren of Khaledan\", 'The island is divided into several provinces,\\nin each of which are large flourishing towns, and the whole forms\\nan important kingdom', 'It was governed in former days by a king\\nnamed Schahzaman, who, with good right, considered himself one of\\nthe most peaceful, prosperous, and fortunate monarchs on the earth', 'In fact, he had but one grievance, which was that none of his four\\nwives had given him an heir', 'This distressed him so greatly that one day he confided his grief\\nto the grand-vizir, who, being a wise counsellor, said:  \"Such matters\\nare indeed beyond human aid', 'Allah alone can grant your desire,\\nand I should advise you, sire, to send large gifts to those holy men\\nwho spend their lives in prayer, and to beg for their intercessions', 'Who knows whether their petitions may not be answered', '\"\\n\\nThe king took his vizir\\'s advice, and the result of so many prayers for\\nan heir to the throne was that a son was born to him the following year', 'Schahzaman sent noble gifts as thank offerings to all the mosques\\nand religious houses, and great rejoicings were celebrated in honour\\nof the birth of the little prince, who was so beautiful that he\\nwas named Camaralzaman, or \"Moon of the Century', '\"\\n\\nPrince Camaralzaman was brought up with extreme care by an excellent\\ngovernor and all the cleverest teachers, and he did such credit to them\\nthat when he was grown up, a more charming and accomplished young man\\nwas not to be found', 'Whilst he was still a youth the king, his father,\\nwho loved him dearly, had some thoughts of abdicating in his favour', 'As usual he talked over his plans with his grand-vizir, who,\\nthough he did not approve the idea, would not state all his objections', '\"Sire,\" he replied, \"the prince is still very young for the cares\\nof state', 'Your Majesty fears his growing idle and careless,\\nand doubtless you are right', 'But how would it be if he were first\\nto marry', 'This would attach him to his home, and your Majesty\\nmight give him a share in your counsels, so that he might gradually\\nlearn how to wear a crown, which you can give up to him whenever\\nyou find him capable of wearing it', '\"\\n\\nThe vizir\\'s advice once more struck the king as being good,\\nand he sent for his son, who lost no time in obeying the summons,\\nand standing respectfully with downcast eyes before the king asked\\nfor his commands', '\"I have sent for you,\" said the king, \"to say that I wish you to marry', 'What do you think about it', '\"\\n\\nThe prince was so much overcome by these words that he remained\\nsilent for some time', 'At length he said:  \"Sire, I beg you\\nto pardon me if I am unable to reply as you might wish', 'I certainly did not expect such a proposal as I am still so young,\\nand I confess that the idea of marrying is very distasteful to me', 'Possibly I may not always be in this mind, but I certainly feel\\nthat it will require some time to induce me to take the step\\nwhich your Majesty desires', '\"\\n\\nThis answer greatly distressed the king, who was sincerely grieved\\nby his objection to marriage', 'However he would not have recourse\\nto extreme measures, so he said:  \"I do not wish to force you;\\nI will give you time to reflect, but remember that such a step\\nis necessary, for a prince such as you who will some day be called\\nto rule over a great kingdom', '\"\\n\\nFrom this time Prince Camaralzaman was admitted to the royal council,\\nand the king showed him every mark of favour', 'At the end of a year the king took his son aside, and said: \\n\"Well, my son, have you changed your mind on the subject of marriage,\\nor do you still refuse to obey my wish', '\"\\n\\nThe prince was less surprised but no less firm than on the\\nformer occasion, and begged his father not to press the subject,\\nadding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer', 'This answer much distressed the king, who again confided his trouble\\nto his vizir', '\"I have followed your advice,\" he said; \"but Camaralzaman declines\\nto marry, and is more obstinate than ever', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the vizir, \"much is gained by patience, and your\\nMajesty might regret any violence', 'Why not wait another year and then\\ninform the Prince in the midst of the assembled council that the good\\nof the state demands his marriage', 'He cannot possibly refuse again\\nbefore so distinguished an assemblage, and in our immediate presence', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once, but he\\nyielded to the vizir\\'s arguments and decided to wait', 'He then visited\\nthe prince\\'s mother, and after telling her of his disappointment\\nand of the further respite he had given his son, he added: \\n\"I know that Camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me', 'Pray speak very seriously to him on this subject, and make him realise\\nthat he will most seriously displease me if he remains obstinate,\\nand that he will certainly regret the measures I shall be obliged\\nto take to enforce my will', '\"\\n\\nSo the first time the Sultana Fatima saw her son she told him she\\nhad heard of his refusal to marry, adding how distressed she felt\\nthat he should have vexed his father so much', 'She asked what reasons\\nhe could have for his objections to obey', '\"Madam,\" replied the prince, \"I make no doubt that there are as\\nmany good, virtuous, sweet, and amiable women as there are others\\nvery much the reverse', 'Would that all were like you', 'But what revolts\\nme is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at all\\nabout her', 'My father will ask the hand of the daughter of some\\nneighbouring sovereign, who will give his consent to our union', 'Be she fair or frightful, clever or stupid, good or bad, I must\\nmarry her, and am left no choice in the matter', 'How am I to know\\nthat she will not be proud, passionate, contemptuous, and recklessly\\nextravagant, or that her disposition will in any way suit mine', '\"\\n\\n\"But, my son,\" urged Fatima, \"you surely do not wish to be the last\\nof a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over this kingdom', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" said the prince, \"I have no wish to survive the king,\\nmy father, but should I do so I will try to reign in such a manner\\nas may be considered worthy of my predecessors', '\"\\n\\nThese and similar conversations proved to the Sultan how useless it\\nwas to argue with his son, and the year elapsed without bringing\\nany change in the prince\\'s ideas', 'At length a day came when the Sultan summoned him before the council,\\nand there informed him that not only his own wishes but the good\\nof the empire demanded his marriage, and desired him to give his\\nanswer before the assembled ministers', 'At this Camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heat\\nthat the king, naturally irritated at being opposed by his son\\nin full council, ordered the prince to be arrested and locked up\\nin an old tower, where he had nothing but a very little furniture,\\na few books, and a single slave to wait on him', 'Camaralzaman, pleased to be free to enjoy his books, showed himself\\nvery indifferent to his sentence', 'When night came he washed himself, performed his devotions,\\nand, having read some pages of the Koran, lay down on a couch,\\nwithout putting out the light near him, and was soon asleep', 'Now there was a deep well in the tower in which Prince\\nCamaralzaman was imprisoned, and this well was a favourite\\nresort of the fairy Maimoune, daughter of Damriat, chief of a\\nlegion of genii', 'Towards midnight Maimoune floated lightly\\nup from the well, intending, according to her usual habit,\\nto roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident might prompt', \"The light in the prince's room surprised her, and without disturbing\\nthe slave, who slept across the threshold, she entered the room,\\nand approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied\", 'The prince lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet', 'Maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youth\\nshe had ever seen', '\"What a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open', '\"\\nshe thought', '\"What can he have done to deserve to be treated\\nlike this', '\"\\n\\nShe could not weary gazing at Camaralzaman, but at length,\\nhaving softly kissed his brow and each cheek, she replaced\\nthe coverlet and resumed her flight through the air', 'As she entered the middle region she heard the sound of great wings\\ncoming towards her, and shortly met one of the race of bad genii', 'This genie, whose name was Danhasch, recognised Maimoune with terror,\\nfor he knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her over him', 'He would gladly have avoided her altogether, but they were so near\\nthat he must either be prepared to fight or yield to her, so he at once\\naddressed her in a conciliatory tone:\\n\\n\"Good Maimoune, swear to me by Allah to do me no harm, and on my\\nside I will promise not to injure you', '\"\\n\\n\"Accursed genie', '\" replied Maimoune, \"what harm can you do me', 'But I will grant your power and give the promise you ask', 'And now\\ntell me what you have seen and done to-night', '\"\\n\\n\"Fair lady,\" said Danhasch, \"you meet me at the right moment to hear\\nsomething really interesting', 'I must tell you that I come from the\\nfurthest end of China, which is one of the largest and most powerful\\nkingdoms in the world', 'The present king has one only daughter, who is\\nso perfectly lovely that neither you, nor I, nor any other creature\\ncould find adequate terms in which to describe her marvellous charms', 'You must therefore picture to yourself the most perfect features,\\njoined to a brilliant and delicate complexion, and an enchanting\\nexpression, and even then imagination will fall short of the reality', '\"\\n\\n\"The king, her father, has carefully shielded this treasure from\\nthe vulgar gaze, and has taken every precaution to keep her from\\nthe sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to be\\nher husband', 'But in order to give her variety in her confinement he\\nhas built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before', 'The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal, the second\\nof bronze, the third of fine steel, the fourth of another and more\\nprecious species of bronze, the fifth of touchstone, the sixth\\nof silver, and the seventh of solid gold', 'They are all most\\nsumptuously furnished, whilst the gardens surrounding them are\\nlaid out with exquisite taste', 'In fact, neither trouble nor cost\\nhas been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess', 'The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide, and many\\npowerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage', 'The king has always received these embassies graciously, but says\\nthat he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will,\\nand as she regularly declines each fresh proposal, the envoys have\\nhad to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as they\\nwere gratified by their magnificent receptions', '\"Sire,\" said the princess to her father, \"you wish me to marry,\\nand I know you desire to please me, for which I am very grateful', 'But, indeed, I have no inclination to change my state,\\nfor where could I find so happy a life amidst so many beautiful\\nand delightful surroundings', 'I feel that I could never be as happy\\nwith any husband as I am here, and I beg you not to press one on me', '\"\\n\\n\"At last an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that the\\nKing of China felt constrained to urge this suit on his daughter', 'He told her how important such an alliance would be, and pressed\\nher to consent', 'In fact, he pressed her so persistingly that the\\nprincess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect due\\nto her father', \"`Sire,' cried she angrily, `do not speak further\\nof this or any other marriage or I will plunge this dagger in my\\nbreast and so escape from all these importunities\", '\\'\"\\n\\n\"The king of China was extremely indignant with his daughter and replied: \\n`You have lost your senses and you must be treated accordingly', '\\'\" \\nSo he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her palaces,\\nand only allowed her ten old women, of whom her nurse was the head,\\nto wait on her and keep her company', \"He next sent letters to all\\nthe kings who had sued for the princess's hand, begging they would\\nthink of her no longer, as she was quite insane, and he desired\\nhis various envoys to make it known that anyone who could cure her\\nshould have her to wife\", '\"Fair Maimoune,\" continued Danhasch, \"this is the present state\\nof affairs', 'I never pass a day without going to gaze on this\\nincomparable beauty, and I am sure that if you would only\\naccompany me you would think the sight well worth the trouble,\\nand own that you never saw such loveliness before', '\"\\n\\nThe fairy only answered with a peal of laughter, and when at length\\nshe had control of her voice she cried, \"Oh, come, you are making\\ngame of me', 'I thought you had something really interesting to tell\\nme instead of raving about some unknown damsel', 'What would you say\\nif you could see the prince I have just been looking at and whose\\nbeauty is really transcendent', 'That is something worth talking about,\\nyou would certainly quite lose your head', '\"\\n\\n\"Charming Maimoune,\" asked Danhasch, \"may I inquire who and what\\nis the prince of whom you speak', '\"\\n\\n\"Know,\" replied Maimoune, \"that he is in much the same case as\\nyour princess', \"The king, his father, wanted to force him to marry,\\nand on the prince's refusal to obey he has been imprisoned in an old\\ntower where I have just seen him\", '\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t like to contradict a lady,\" said Danhasch, \"but you must\\nreally permit me to doubt any mortal being as beautiful as my princess', '\"\\n\\n\"Hold your tongue,\" cried Maimoune', '\"I repeat that is impossible', '\"\\n\\n\"Well, I don\\'t wish to seem obstinate,\" replied Danhasch, \"the best\\nplan to test the truth of what I say will be for you to let me\\ntake you to see the princess for yourself', '\"\\n\\n\"There is no need for that,\" retorted Maimoune; \"we can satisfy\\nourselves in another way', 'Bring your princess here and lay\\nher down beside my prince', 'We can then compare them at leisure,\\nand decide which is in the right', '\"\\n\\nDanhasch readily consented, and after having the tower where the prince\\nwas confined pointed out to him, and making a wager with Maimoune as to\\nthe result of the comparison, he flew off to China to fetch the princess', 'In an incredibly short time Danhasch returned, bearing the\\nsleeping princess', \"Maimoune led him to the prince's room,\\nand the rival beauty was placed beside him\", 'When the prince and princess lay thus side by side, an animated\\ndispute as to their respective charms arose between the fairy\\nand the genius', 'Danhasch began by saying:\\n\\n\"Now you see that my princess is more beautiful than your prince', 'Can you doubt any longer', '\"\\n\\n\"Doubt', 'Of course I do', '\" exclaimed Maimoune', '\"Why, you must\\nbe blind not to see how much my prince excels your princess', 'I do not deny that your princess is very handsome, but only look\\nand you must own that I am in the right', '\"\\n\\n\"There is no need for me to look longer,\" said Danhasch, \"my first\\nimpression will remain the same; but of course, charming Maimoune,\\nI am ready to yield to you if you insist on it', '\"\\n\\n\"By no means,\" replied Maimoune', '\"I have no idea of being under\\nany obligation to an accursed genius like you', 'I refer the matter\\nto an umpire, and shall expect you to submit to his verdict', '\"\\n\\nDanhasch readily agreed, and on Maimoune striking the floor with her\\nfoot it opened, and a hideous, hump-backed, lame, squinting genius,\\nwith six horns on his head, hands like claws, emerged', 'As soon as he\\nbeheld Maimoune he threw himself at her feet and asked her commands', '\"Rise, Caschcasch,\" said she', '\"I summoned you to judge between me\\nand Danhasch', 'Glance at that couch, and say without any partiality\\nwhether you think the youth or the maiden lying there the more beautiful', '\"\\n\\nCaschcasch looked at the prince and princess with every token\\nof surprise and admiration', 'At length, having gazed long without\\nbeing able to come to a decision, he said\\n\\n\"Madam, I must confess that I should deceive you were I to declare\\none to be handsomer than the other', 'There seems to me only one\\nway in which to decide the matter, and that is to wake one after\\nthe other and judge which of them expresses the greater admiration\\nfor the other', '\"\\n\\nThis advice pleased Maimoune and Danhasch, and the fairy at once\\ntransformed herself into the shape of a gnat and settling on\\nCamaralzaman\\'s throat stung him so sharply that he awoke', 'As he did\\nso his eyes fell on the Princess of China', 'Surprised at finding\\na lady so near him, he raised himself on one arm to look at her', 'The youth and beauty of the princess at once awoke a feeling to which his\\nheart had as yet been a stranger, and he could not restrain his delight', '\"What loveliness', 'What charms', 'Oh, my heart, my soul', '\" he exclaimed,\\nas he kissed her forehead, her eyes and mouth in a way which would\\ncertainly have roused her had not the genie\\'s enchantments kept\\nher asleep', '\"How, fair lady', '\" he cried, \"you do not wake at the signs of\\nCamaralzaman\\'s love', 'Be you who you may, he is not unworthy of you', '\"\\n\\nIt then suddenly occurred to him, that perhaps this was the bride\\nhis father had destined for him, and that the King had probably\\nhad her placed in this room in order to see how far Camaralzaman\\'s\\naversion to marriage would withstand her charms', '\"At all events,\" he thought, \"I will take this ring as a remembrance\\nof her', '\"\\n\\nSo saying he drew off a fine ring which the princess wore on\\nher finger, and replaced it by one of his own', 'After which he\\nlay down again and was soon fast asleep', 'Then Danhasch, in his turn, took the form of a gnat and bit\\nthe princess on her lip', 'She started up, and was not a little amazed at seeing a young man\\nbeside her', 'From surprise she soon passed to admiration, and then\\nto delight on perceiving how handsome and fascinating he was', '\"Why,\" cried she, \"was it you my father wished me to marry', 'How unlucky that I did not know sooner', 'I should not have made\\nhim so angry', 'But wake up', 'wake up', 'for I know I shall love you\\nwith all my heart', '\"\\n\\nSo saying she shook Camaralzaman so violently that nothing\\nbut the spells of Maimoune could have prevented his waking', '\"Oh', '\" cried the princess', '\"Why are you so drowsy', '\"  So saying she\\ntook his hand and noticed her own ring on his finger, which made her\\nwonder still more', 'But as he still remained in a profound slumber\\nshe pressed a kiss on his cheek and soon fell fast asleep too', 'Then Maimoune turning to the genie said:  \"Well, are you satisfied\\nthat my prince surpasses your princess', 'Another time pray believe\\nme when I assert anything', '\"\\n\\nThen turning to Caschcasch:  \"My thanks to you, and now do you\\nand Danhasch bear the princess back to her own home', '\"\\n\\nThe two genii hastened to obey, and Maimoune returned to her well', 'On waking next morning the first thing Prince Camaralzaman did\\nwas to look round for the lovely lady he had seen at night,\\nand the next to question the slave who waited on him about her', 'But the slave persisted so strongly that he knew nothing of any lady,\\nand still less of how she got into the tower, that the prince lost\\nall patience, and after giving him a good beating tied a rope round him\\nand ducked him in the well till the unfortunate man cried out that he\\nwould tell everything', 'Then the prince drew him up all dripping wet,\\nbut the slave begged leave to change his clothes first, and as soon\\nas the prince consented hurried off just as he was to the palace', 'Here he found the king talking to the grand-vizir of all the anxiety\\nhis son had caused him', 'The slave was admitted at once and cried:\\n\\n\"Alas, Sire', 'I bring sad news to your Majesty', 'There can be no\\ndoubt that the prince has completely lost his senses', 'He declares\\nthat he saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night, and the state\\nyou see me in proves how violent contradiction makes him', '\" \\nHe then gave a minute account of all the prince had said and done', 'The king, much moved, begged the vizir to examine into this\\nnew misfortune, and the latter at once went to the tower, where he\\nfound the prince quietly reading a book', 'After the first exchange\\nof greetings the vizir said:\\n\\n\"I feel really very angry with your slave for alarming his Majesty\\nby the news he brought him', '\"\\n\\n\"What news', '\" asked the prince', '\"Ah', '\" replied the vizir, \"something absurd, I feel sure, seeing how\\nI find you', '\"\\n\\n\"Most likely,\" said the prince; \"but now that you are here I am\\nglad of the opportunity to ask you where is the lady who slept\\nin this room last night', '\"\\n\\nThe grand-vizir felt beside himself at this question', '\"Prince', '\" he exclaimed, \"how would it be possible for any man,\\nmuch less a woman, to enter this room at night without walking over\\nyour slave on the threshold', 'Pray consider the matter, and you\\nwill realise that you have been deeply impressed by some dream', '\"\\n\\nBut the prince angrily insisted on knowing who and where the lady was,\\nand was not to be persuaded by all the vizir\\'s protestations to the\\ncontrary that the plot had not been one of his making', 'At last,\\nlosing patience, he seized the vizir by the beard and loaded him\\nwith blows', '\"Stop, Prince,\" cried the unhappy vizir, \"stay and hear what I\\nhave to say', '\"\\n\\nThe prince, whose arm was getting tired, paused', '\"I confess, Prince,\" said the vizir, \"that there is some foundation\\nfor what you say', \"But you know well that a minister has to carry\\nout his master's orders\", 'Allow me to go and to take to the king\\nany message you may choose to send', '\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" said the prince; \"then go and tell him that I consent\\nto marry the lady whom he sent or brought here last night', 'Be quick and bring me back his answer', '\"\\n\\nThe vizir bowed to the ground and hastened to leave the room and tower', '\"Well,\" asked the king as soon as he appeared, \"and how did you\\nfind my son', '\"\\n\\n\"Alas, sire,\" was the reply, \"the slave\\'s report is only too true', '\"\\n\\nHe then gave an exact account of his interview with Camaralzaman\\nand of the prince\\'s fury when told that it was not possible for any\\nlady to have entered his room, and of the treatment he himself\\nhad received', 'The king, much distressed, determined to clear\\nup the matter himself, and, ordering the vizir to follow him,\\nset out to visit his son', 'The prince received his father with profound respect, and the king,\\nmaking him sit beside him, asked him several questions, to which\\nCamaralzaman replied with much good sense', 'At last the king said: \\n\"My son, pray tell me about the lady who, it is said, was in your room\\nlast night', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the prince, \"pray do not increase my distress\\nin this matter, but rather make me happy by giving her to me\\nin marriage', 'However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly,\\nthe sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices,\\nand I will gratefully receive her from your hands', '\"\\n\\nThe king was almost speechless on hearing his son, but after a time\\nassured him most solemnly that he knew nothing whatever about\\nthe lady in question, and had not connived at her appearance', 'He then desired the prince to relate the whole story to him', 'Camaralzaman did so at great length, showed the ring, and implored\\nhis father to help to find the bride he so ardently desired', '\"After all you tell me,\" remarked the king, \"I can no longer doubt\\nyour word; but how and whence the lady came, or why she should\\nhave stayed so short a time I cannot imagine', 'The whole affair\\nis indeed mysterious', 'Come, my dear son, let us wait together\\nfor happier days', '\"\\n\\nSo saying the king took Camaralzaman by the hand and led him back\\nto the palace, where the prince took to his bed and gave himself up\\nto despair, and the king shutting himself up with his son entirely\\nneglected the affairs of state', 'The prime minister, who was the only person admitted, felt it his\\nduty at last to tell the king how much the court and all the people\\ncomplained of his seclusion, and how bad it was for the nation', \"He urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely little\\nisland close by, whence he could easily attend public audiences,\\nand where the charming scenery and fine air would do the invalid so\\nmuch good as to enable him to bear his father's occasional absence\", 'The king approved the plan, and as soon as the castle on the island\\ncould be prepared for their reception he and the prince arrived there,\\nSchahzaman never leaving his son except for the prescribed public\\naudiences twice a week', 'Whilst all this was happening in the capital of Schahzaman the two\\ngenii had carefully borne the Princess of China back to her own\\npalace and replaced her in bed', 'On waking next morning she first\\nturned from one side to another and then, finding herself alone,\\ncalled loudly for her women', '\"Tell me,\" she cried, \"where is the young man I love so dearly,\\nand who slept near me last night', '\"\\n\\n\"Princess,\" exclaimed the nurse, \"we cannot tell what you allude\\nto without more explanation', '\"\\n\\n\"Why,\" continued the princess, \"the most charming and beautiful young\\nman lay sleeping beside me last night', 'I did my utmost to wake him,\\nbut in vain', '\"\\n\\n\"Your Royal Highness wishes to make game of us,\" said the nurse', '\"Is it your pleasure to rise', '\"\\n\\n\"I am quite in earnest,\" persisted the princess, \"and I want to know\\nwhere he is', '\"\\n\\n\"But, Princess,\" expostulated the nurse, \"we left you quite alone\\nlast night, and we have seen no one enter your room since then', '\"\\n\\nAt this the princess lost all patience, and taking the nurse by her\\nhair she boxed her ears soundly, crying out:  \"You shall tell me,\\nyou old witch, or I\\'ll kill you', '\"\\n\\nThe nurse had no little trouble in escaping, and hurried off to\\nthe queen, to whom she related the whole story with tears in her eyes', '\"You see, madam,\" she concluded, \"that the princess must be out\\nof her mind', 'If only you will come and see her, you will be able\\nto judge for yourself', '\"\\n\\nThe queen hurried to her daughter\\'s apartments, and after tenderly\\nembracing her, asked her why she had treated her nurse so badly', '\"Madam,\" said the princess, \"I perceive that your Majesty wishes\\nto make game of me, but I can assure you that I will never marry\\nanyone except the charming young man whom I saw last night', 'You must know where he is, so pray send for him', '\"\\n\\nThe queen was much surprised by these words, but when she\\ndeclared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter the\\nprincess lost all respect, and answered that if she were not\\nallowed to marry as she wished she should kill herself, and\\nit was in vain that the queen tried to pacify her and bring her to reason', 'The king himself came to hear the rights of the matter, but the\\nprincess only persisted in her story, and as a proof showed the ring\\non her finger', 'The king hardly knew what to make of it all, but ended\\nby thinking that his daughter was more crazy than ever, and without\\nfurther argument he had her placed in still closer confinement,\\nwith only her nurse to wait on her and a powerful guard to keep the door', 'Then he assembled his council, and having told them the sad state\\nof things, added:  \"If any of you can succeed in curing the princess,\\nI will give her to him in marriage, and he shall be my heir', '\"\\n\\nAn elderly emir present, fired with the desire to possess a young\\nand lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom, offered to try\\nthe magic arts with which he was acquainted', '\"You are welcome to try,\" said the king, \"but I make one condition,\\nwhich is, that should you fail you will lose your life', '\"\\n\\nThe emir accepted the condition, and the king led him to the princess,\\nwho, veiling her face, remarked, \"I am surprised, sire, that you\\nshould bring an unknown man into my presence', '\"\\n\\n\"You need not be shocked,\" said the king; \"this is one of my emirs\\nwho asks your hand in marriage', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the princess, \"this is not the one you gave me\\nbefore and whose ring I wear', 'Permit me to say that I can accept\\nno other', '\"\\n\\nThe emir, who had expected to hear the princess talk nonsense,\\nfinding how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king that he\\ncould not venture to undertake a cure, but placed his head at his\\nMajesty\\'s disposal, on which the justly irritated monarch promptly\\nhad it cut off', 'This was the first of many suitors for the princess whose inability\\nto cure her cost them their lives', \"Now it happened that after things had been going on in this way for\\nsome time the nurse's son Marzavan returned from his travels\", 'He had\\nbeen in many countries and learnt many things, including astrology', 'Needless to say that one of the first things his mother told him\\nwas the sad condition of the princess, his foster-sister', \"Marzavan\\nasked if she could not manage to let him see the princess without\\nthe king's knowledge\", \"After some consideration his mother consented, and even persuaded\\nthe eunuch on guard to make no objection to Marzavan's entering\\nthe royal apartment\", 'The princess was delighted to see her foster-brother again,\\nand after some conversation she confided to him all her history\\nand the cause of her imprisonment', 'Marzavan listened with downcast eyes and the utmost attention', 'When she had finished speaking he said,\\n\\n\"If what you tell me, Princess, is indeed the case, I do not despair\\nof finding comfort for you', 'Take patience yet a little longer', 'I will set out at once to explore other countries, and when you hear\\nof my return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far off', '\" \\nSo saying, he took his leave and started next morning on his travels', 'Marzavan journeyed from city to city and from one island and province\\nto another, and wherever he went he heard people talk of the strange\\nstory of the Princess Badoura, as the Princess of China was named', 'After four months he reached a large populous seaport town named Torf,\\nand here he heard no more of the Princess Badoura but a great deal\\nof Prince Camaralzaman, who was reported ill, and whose story\\nsounded very similar to that of the Princess Badoura', \"Marzavan was rejoiced, and set out at once for Prince\\nCamaralzaman's residence\", 'The ship on which he embarked had\\na prosperous voyage till she got within sight of the capital\\nof King Schahzaman, but when just about to enter the harbour she\\nsuddenly struck on a rock, and foundered within sight of the\\npalace where the prince was living with his father and the grand-vizir', 'Marzavan, who swam well, threw himself into the sea and managed\\nto land close to the palace, where he was kindly received,\\nand after having a change of clothing given him was brought before\\nthe grand-vizir', 'The vizir was at once attracted by the young man\\'s\\nsuperior air and intelligent conversation, and perceiving that he\\nhad gained much experience in the course of his travels, he said,\\n\"Ah, how I wish you had learnt some secret which might enable you\\nto cure a malady which has plunged this court into affliction\\nfor some time past', '\"\\n\\nMarzavan replied that if he knew what the illness was he might\\npossibly be able to suggest a remedy, on which the vizir related\\nto him the whole history of Prince Camaralzaman', \"On hearing this Marzavan rejoiced inwardly, for he felt sure that he\\nhad at last discovered the object of the Princess Badoura's infatuation\", 'However, he said nothing, but begged to be allowed to see the prince', 'On entering the royal apartment the first thing which struck\\nhim was the prince himself, who lay stretched out on his bed\\nwith his eyes closed', 'The king sat near him, but, without paying\\nany regard to his presence, Marzavan exclaimed, \"Heavens', 'what a\\nstriking likeness', '\"  And, indeed, there was a good deal of resemblance\\nbetween the features of Camaralzaman and those of the Princess of China', 'These words caused the prince to open his eyes with languid curiosity,\\nand Marzavan seized this moment to pay him his compliments,\\ncontriving at the same time to express the condition of the Princess\\nof China in terms unintelligible, indeed, to the Sultan and his vizir,\\nbut which left the prince in no doubt that his visitor could give\\nhim some welcome information', 'The prince begged his father to allow him the favour of a private\\ninterview with Marzavan, and the king was only too pleased to find\\nhis son taking an interest in anyone or anything', 'As soon as they\\nwere left alone Marzavan told the prince the story of the Princess\\nBadoura and her sufferings, adding, \"I am convinced that you alone\\ncan cure her; but before starting on so long a journey you must\\nbe well and strong, so do your best to recover as quickly as may be', '\"\\n\\nThese words produced a great effect on the prince, who was so much\\ncheered by the hopes held out that he declared he felt able\\nto get up and be dressed', \"The king was overjoyed at the result\\nof Marzavan s interview, and ordered public rejoicings in honour\\nof the prince's recovery\", 'Before long the prince was quite restored to his original state\\nof health, and as soon as he felt himself really strong he took\\nMarzavan aside and said:\\n\\n\"Now is the time to perform your promise', 'I am so impatient to see\\nmy beloved princess once more that I am sure I shall fall ill\\nagain if we do not start soon', \"The one obstacle is my father's\\ntender care of me, for, as you may have noticed, he cannot bear\\nme out of his sight\", '\"\\n\\n\"Prince,\" replied Marzavan, \"I have already thought over the matter,\\nand this is what seems to me the best plan', 'You have not been\\nout of doors since my arrival', \"Ask the king's permission to go\\nwith me for two or three days' hunting, and when he has given\\nleave order two good horses to be held ready for each of us\", 'Leave all the rest to me', '\"\\n\\nNext day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for making\\nhis request, and the king gladly granted it on condition that\\nonly one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigue\\nafter such a long illness', 'Next morning Prince Camaralzaman and Marzavan were off betimes,\\nattended by two grooms leading the two extra horses', 'They hunted\\na little by the way, but took care to get as far from the towns\\nas possible', 'At night-fall they reached an inn, where they supped\\nand slept till midnight', 'Then Marzavan awoke and roused the prince\\nwithout disturbing anyone else', 'He begged the prince to give him\\nthe coat he had been wearing and to put on another which they had\\nbrought with them', \"They mounted their second horses, and Marzavan\\nled one of the grooms' horses by the bridle\", 'By daybreak our travellers found themselves where four cross roads\\nmet in the middle of the forest', \"Here Marzavan begged the prince\\nto wait for him, and leading the groom's horse into a dense part\\nof the wood he cut its throat, dipped the prince's coat in its blood,\\nand having rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground where\\nthe roads parted\", \"In answer to Camaralzaman's inquiries as to the reason for this,\\nMarzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their journey\\nwas to divert attention by creating the idea of the prince's death\", '\"Your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief,\"\\nhe went on, \"but his joy at your return will be all the greater', '\"\\n\\nThe prince and his companion now continued their journey by land\\nand sea, and as they had brought plenty of money to defray their\\nexpenses they met with no needless delays', 'At length they reached\\nthe capital of China, where they spent three days in a suitable\\nlodging to recover from their fatigues', \"During this time Marzavan had an astrologer's dress\\nprepared for the prince\", \"They then went to the baths,\\nafter which the prince put on the astrologer's robe and was\\nconducted within sight of the king's palace by Marzavan,\\nwho left him there and went to consult his mother, the princess's nurse\", 'Meantime the prince, according to Marzavan\\'s instructions,\\nadvanced close to the palace gates and there proclaimed aloud:\\n\\n\"I am an astrologer and I come to restore health to\\nthe Princess Badoura, daughter of the high and mighty\\nKing of China, on the conditions laid down by His\\nMajesty of marrying her should I succeed, or of losing my life if I fail', '\"\\n\\nIt was some little time since anyone had presented himself to run\\nthe terrible risk involved in attempting to cure the princess,\\nand a crowd soon gathered round the prince', 'On perceiving his youth,\\ngood looks, and distinguished bearing, everyone felt pity for him', '\"What are you thinking of, sir,\" exclaimed some; \"why expose yourself\\nto certain death', 'Are not the heads you see exposed on the town\\nwall sufficient warning', \"For mercy's sake give up this mad idea\\nand retire whilst you can\", '\"\\n\\nBut the prince remained firm, and only repeated his cry with\\ngreater assurance, to the horror of the crowd', '\"He is resolved to die', '\" they cried; \"may heaven have pity on him', '\"\\n\\nCamaralzaman now called out for the third time, and at last\\nthe grand-vizir himself came out and fetched him in', 'The prime minister led the prince to the king, who was much struck\\nby the noble air of this new adventurer, and felt such pity for\\nthe fate so evidently in store for him, that he tried to persuade\\nthe young man to renounce his project', \"But Camaralzaman politely yet firmly persisted in his intentions,\\nand at length the king desired the eunuch who had the guard of the\\nprincess's apartments to conduct the astrologer to her presence\", 'The eunuch led the way through long passages, and Camaralzaman\\nfollowed rapidly, in haste to reach the object of his desires', 'At last they came to a large hall which was the ante-room to the\\nprincess\\'s chamber, and here Camaralzaman said to the eunuch:\\n\\n\"Now you shall choose', 'Shall I cure the princess in her own presence,\\nor shall I do it from here without seeing her', '\"\\n\\nThe eunuch, who had expressed many contemptuous doubts as they came\\nalong of the newcomer\\'s powers, was much surprised and said:\\n\\n\"If you really can cure, it is immaterial when you do it', 'Your fame will be equally great', '\"\\n\\n\"Very well,\" replied the prince:  \"then, impatient though I am\\nto see the princess, I will effect the cure where I stand,\\nthe better to convince you of my power', '\"  He accordingly drew\\nout his writing case and wrote as follows--\"Adorable princess', 'The enamoured Camaralzaman has never forgotten the moment when,\\ncontemplating your sleeping beauty, he gave you his heart', 'As he was at that time deprived of the happiness of conversing\\nwith you, he ventured to give you his ring as a token of his love,\\nand to take yours in exchange, which he now encloses in this letter', 'Should you deign to return it to him he will be the happiest\\nof mortals, if not he will cheerfully resign himself to death,\\nseeing he does so for love of you', 'He awaits your reply in your\\nante-room', '\"\\n\\nHaving finished this note the prince carefully enclosed the ring in it\\nwithout letting the eunuch see it, and gave him the letter, saying:\\n\\n\"Take this to your mistress, my friend, and if on reading it\\nand seeing its contents she is not instantly cured, you may call\\nme an impudent impostor', '\"\\n\\nThe eunuch at once passed into the princess\\'s room, and handing\\nher the letter said:\\n\\n\"Madam, a new astrologer has arrived, who declares that you will be\\ncured as soon as you have read this letter and seen what it contains', '\"\\n\\nThe princess took the note and opened it with languid indifference', 'But no sooner did she see her ring than, barely glancing at the writing,\\nshe rose hastily and with one bound reached the doorway and pushed\\nback the hangings', \"Here she and the prince recognised each other,\\nand in a moment they were locked in each other's arms, where they\\ntenderly embraced, wondering how they came to meet at last after\\nso long a separation\", 'The nurse, who had hastened after her charge,\\ndrew them back to the inner room, where the princess restored her ring\\nto Camaralzaman', '\"Take it back,\" she said, \"I could not keep it without returning\\nyours to you, and I am resolved to wear that as long as I live', '\"\\n\\nMeantime the eunuch had hastened back to the king', '\"Sire,\" he cried,\\n\"all the former doctors and astrologers were mere quacks', 'This man has cured the princess without even seeing her', '\" \\nHe then told all to the king, who, overjoyed, hastened to his\\ndaughter\\'s apartments, where, after embracing her, he placed\\nher hand in that of the prince, saying:\\n\\n\"Happy stranger, I keep my promise, and give you my daughter to wife,\\nbe you who you may', 'But, if I am not much mistaken, your condition\\nis above what you appear to be', '\"\\n\\nThe prince thanked the king in the warmest and most respectful terms,\\nand added:  \"As regards my person, your Majesty has rightly guessed\\nthat I am not an astrologer', 'It is but a disguise which I assumed\\nin order to merit your illustrious alliance', 'I am myself a prince,\\nmy name is Camaralzaman, and my father is Schahzaman, King of the\\nIsles of the Children of Khaledan', '\"  He then told his whole history,\\nincluding the extraordinary manner of his first seeing and loving\\nthe Princess Badoura', 'When he had finished the king exclaimed:  \"So remarkable a story must\\nnot be lost to posterity', 'It shall be inscribed in the archives\\nof my kingdom and published everywhere abroad', '\"\\n\\nThe wedding took place next day amidst great pomp and rejoicings', 'Marzavan was not forgotten, but was given a lucrative post at court,\\nwith a promise of further advancement', \"The prince and princess were now entirely happy, and months slipped\\nby unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other's society\", 'One night, however, Prince Camaralzaman dreamt that he saw his\\nfather lying at the point of death, and saying:  \"Alas', 'my son whom\\nI loved so tenderly, has deserted me and is now causing my death', '\"\\n\\nThe prince woke with such a groan as to startle the princess,\\nwho asked what was the matter', '\"Ah', '\" cried the prince, \"at this very moment my father is perhaps\\nno more', '\" and he told his dream', 'The princess said but little at the time, but next morning she went\\nto the king, and kissing his hand said:\\n\\n\"I have a favour to ask of your Majesty, and I beg you to believe\\nthat it is in no way prompted by my husband', 'It is that you will\\nallow us both to visit my father-in-law King Schahzaman', '\"\\n\\nSorry though the king felt at the idea of parting with his daughter,\\nhe felt her request to be so reasonable that he could not refuse it,\\nand made but one condition, which was that she should only spend\\none year at the court of King Schahzaman, suggesting that in future\\nthe young couple should visit their respective parents alternately', 'The princess brought this good news to her husband, who thanked\\nher tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection', 'All preparations for the journey were now pressed forwards, and when\\nall was ready the king accompanied the travellers for some days,\\nafter which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter, and charging\\nthe prince to take every care of her, returned to his capital', 'The prince and princess journeyed on, and at the end of a month\\nreached a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees which cast\\na most pleasant shade', 'As the heat was great, Camaralzaman thought it\\nwell to encamp in this cool spot', 'Accordingly the tents were pitched,\\nand the princess entering hers whilst the prince was giving his\\nfurther orders, removed her girdle, which she placed beside her,\\nand desiring her women to leave her, lay down and was soon asleep', 'When the camp was all in order the prince entered the tent and,\\nseeing the princess asleep, he sat down near her without speaking', 'His eyes fell on the girdle which, he took up, and whilst inspecting\\nthe precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch sewn\\nto the girdle and fastened by a loop', 'He touched it and felt\\nsomething hard within', 'Curious as to what this might be, he opened\\nthe pouch and found a cornelian engraved with various figures\\nand strange characters', '\"This cornelian must be something very precious,\" thought he,\\n\"or my wife would not wear it on her person with so much care', '\"\\n\\nIn truth it was a talisman which the Queen of China had given\\nher daughter, telling her it would ensure her happiness as long\\nas she carried it about her', 'The better to examine the stone the prince stepped to the open\\ndoorway of the tent', 'As he stood there holding it in the open\\npalm of his hand, a bird suddenly swooped down, picked the stone\\nup in its beak and flew away with it', \"Imagine the prince's dismay at losing a thing by which his wife\\nevidently set such store\", 'The bird having secured its prey flew off some yards and\\nalighted on the ground, holding the talisman it its beak', 'Prince Camaralzaman advanced, hoping the bird would drop it, but as\\nsoon as he approached the thief fluttered on a little further still', 'He continued his pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stone\\nand took a longer flight than before', 'The prince then hoped to kill\\nit with a stone, but the more hotly he pursued the further flew the bird', 'In this fashion he was led on by hill and dale through the entire day,\\nand when night came the tiresome creature roosted on the top\\nof a very high tree where it could rest in safety', 'The prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to think\\nwhether he had better return to the camp', '\"But,\" thought he,\\n\"how shall I find my way back', 'Must I go up hill or down', 'I should certainly lose my way in the dark, even if my strength\\nheld out', '\"  Overwhelmed by hunger, thirst, fatigue and sleep,\\nhe ended by spending the night at the foot of the tree', 'Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch,\\nand no sooner did it take flight than he followed it again\\nwith as little success as the previous day, only stopping to eat\\nsome herbs and fruit he found by the way', 'In this fashion he\\nspent ten days, following the bird all day and spending the night\\nat the foot of a tree, whilst it roosted on the topmost bough', 'On the eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large town,\\nand as soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a sudden\\nand higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight,\\nwhilst Camaralzaman felt in despair at having to give up all hopes\\nof ever recovering the talisman of the Princess Badoura', 'Much cast down, he entered the town, which was built near the sea\\nand had a fine harbour', 'He walked about the streets for a long time,\\nnot knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the seashore\\nhe found a garden door open and walked in', 'The gardener, a good old man, who was at work, happened to look up,\\nand, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as a Mussulman,\\nhe told him to come in at once and to shut the door', 'Camaralzaman did as he was bid, and inquired why this precaution\\nwas taken', '\"Because,\" said the gardener, \"I see that you are a stranger and\\na Mussulman, and this town is almost entirely inhabited by idolaters,\\nwho hate and persecute all of our faith', 'It seems almost a miracle\\nthat has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that you\\nhave found a place of safety', '\"\\n\\nCamaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him shelter,\\nand was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted him with:\\n\\n\"Leave compliments alone', 'You are weary and must be hungry', 'Come in, eat, and rest', '\"  So saying he led the prince into his cottage,\\nand after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause of\\nhis arrival', \"Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and ended by inquiring\\nthe shortest way to his father's capital\", '\"For,\" added he,\\n\"if I tried to rejoin the princess, how should I find her after\\neleven days\\' separation', 'Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer alive', '\" \\nAt this terrible thought he burst into tears', \"The gardener informed Camaralzaman that they were quite a year's land\\njourney to any Mahomedan country, but that there was a much shorter\\nroute by sea to the Ebony Island, from whence the Isles of the Children\\nof Khaledan could be easily reached, and that a ship sailed once\\na year for the Ebony Island by which he might get so far as his very home\", '\"If only you had arrived a few days sooner,\" he said, \"you might\\nhave embarked at once', 'As it is you must now wait till next year,\\nbut if you care to stay with me I offer you my house, such as it is,\\nwith all my heart', '\"\\n\\nPrince Camaralzaman thought himself lucky to find some place of refuge,\\nand gladly accepted the gardener\\'s offer', 'He spent his days working in\\nthe garden, and his nights thinking of and sighing for his beloved wife', 'Let us now see what had become during this time of the Princess Badoura', 'On first waking she was much surprised not to find the prince\\nnear her', 'She called her women and asked if they knew where he was,\\nand whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enter\\nthe tent, but had not noticed his leaving it, she took up her belt\\nand perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone', 'She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortly\\nbring it back', 'She waited for him till evening rather impatiently,\\nand wondering what could have kept him from her so long', 'When night\\ncame without him she felt in despair and abused the talisman\\nand its maker roundly', 'In spite of her grief and anxiety however,\\nshe did not lose her presence of mind, but decided on a courageous,\\nthough very unusual step', \"Only the princess and her women knew of Camaralzaman's disappearance,\\nfor the rest of the party were sleeping or resting in their tents\", \"Fearing some treason should the truth be known, she ordered her\\nwomen not to say a word which would give rise to any suspicion,\\nand proceeded to change her dress for one of her husband's, to whom,\\nas has been already said, she bore a strong likeness\", 'In this disguise she looked so like the prince that when she gave\\norders next morning to break up the camp and continue the journey no\\none suspected the change', 'She made one of her women enter her litter,\\nwhilst she herself mounted on horseback and the march began', 'After a protracted journey by land and sea the princess, still under\\nthe name and disguise of Prince Camaralzaman, arrived at the capital\\nof the Ebony Island whose king was named Armanos', 'No sooner did the king hear that the ship which was just in port\\nhad on board the son of his old friend and ally than he hurried\\nto meet the supposed prince, and had him and his retinue brought\\nto the palace, where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously', 'After three days, finding that his guest, to whom he had taken\\na great fancy, talked of continuing his journey, King Armanos said\\nto him:\\n\\n\"Prince, I am now an old man, and unfortunately 1 have no son\\nto whom to leave my kingdom', 'It has pleased Heaven to give me\\nonly one daughter, who possesses such great beauty and charm\\nthat I could only give her to a prince as highly born and as\\naccomplished as yourself', 'Instead, therefore, of returning to your\\nown country, take my daughter and my crown and stay with us', 'I shall feel that I have a worthy successor, and shall cheerfully\\nretire from the fatigues of government', '\"\\n\\nThe king\\'s offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the Princess\\nBadoura', 'She felt that it was equally impossible to confess that she\\nhad deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on which he had set his heart;\\na refusal which might turn all his kindness to hatred and persecution', 'All things considered, she decided to accept, and after a few moments\\nsilence said with a blush, which the king attributed to modesty:\\n\\n\"Sire, I feel so great an obligation for the good opinion\\nyour Majesty has expressed for my person and of the honour\\nyou do me, that, though I am quite unworthy of it,\\nI dare not refuse', 'But, sire, I can only accept such\\nan alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with your counsels', '\"\\n\\nThe marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony was fixed for the\\nfollowing day, and the princess employed the intervening time in\\ninforming the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring them\\nthat the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the marriage', 'She also told her women, and bade them keep her secret well', 'King Armanos, delighted with the success of his plans, lost no\\ntime in assembling his court and council, to whom he presented\\nhis successor, and placing his future son-in-law on the throne\\nmade everyone do homage and take oaths of allegiance to the new king', \"At night the whole town was filled with rejoicings, and with much pomp\\nthe Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of the king's daughter)\\nwas conducted to the palace of the Princess Badoura\", \"Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her first\\ninterview with King Armanos' daughter, and she felt the only thing\\nto do was at once to take her into her confidence\", 'Accordingly, as soon as they were alone she took Haiatelnefous\\nby the hand and said:\\n\\n\"Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and must throw myself\\non your mercy', 'I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princess\\nlike yourself and his wife, and I beg you to listen to my story,\\nthen I am sure you will forgive my imposture, in consideration\\nof my sufferings', '\"\\n\\nShe then related her whole history, and at its close Haiatelnefous\\nembraced her warmly, and assured her of her entire sympathy\\nand affection', \"The two princesses now planned out their future action, and agreed\\nto combine to keep up the deception and to let Badoura continue\\nto play a man's part until such time as there might be news\\nof the real Camaralzaman\", 'Whilst these things were passing in the Ebony Island Prince\\nCamaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottage\\nin the town of the idolaters', 'Early one morning the gardener said to the prince:\\n\\n\"To-day is a public holiday, and the people of the town not only\\ndo not work themselves but forbid others to do so', 'You had better\\ntherefore take a good rest whilst I go to see some friends, and as\\nthe time is near for the arrival of the ship of which I told you I\\nwill make inquiries about it, and try to bespeak a passage for you', '\" \\nHe then put on his best clothes and went out, leaving the prince,\\nwho strolled into the garden and was soon lost in thoughts of his\\ndear wife and their sad separation', 'As he walked up and down he was suddenly disturbed in his reverie\\nby the noise two large birds were making in a tree', 'Camaralzaman stood still and looked up, and saw that the birds were\\nfighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long one fell dead\\nto the ground, whilst the conqueror spread his wings and flew away', 'Almost immediately two other larger birds, who had been watching the duel,\\nflew up and alighted, one at the head and the other at the feet of\\nthe dead bird', 'They stood there some time sadly shaking their heads,\\nand then dug up a grave with their claws in which they buried him', 'As soon as they had filled in the grave the two flew off, and ere\\nlong returned, bringing with them the murderer, whom they held,\\none by a wing and the other by a leg, with their beaks, screaming and\\nstruggling with rage and terror', \"But they held tight, and having\\nbrought him to his victim's grave, they proceeded to kill him,\\nafter which they tore open his body, scattered the inside and once\\nmore flew away\", 'The prince, who had watched the whole scene with much interest,\\nnow drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the dead\\nbird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallen\\nout of its inside', \"He picked it up, and what was his surprise when he\\nrecognised the Princess Badoura's talisman which had been the cause\\nof many misfortunes\", 'It would be impossible to describe his joy;\\nhe kissed the talisman repeatedly, wrapped it up, and carefully\\ntied it round his arm', 'For the first time since his separation\\nfrom the princess he had a good night, and next morning he was up\\nat day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do', 'The gardener told him to cut down an old fruit tree which had quite\\ndied away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to vigorously', 'As he was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something hard', 'On pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze,\\nunder which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps', 'He went down them and found himself in a roomy kind of cave\\nin which stood fifty large bronze jars, each with a cover on it', 'The prince uncovered one after another, and found them all filled\\nwith gold dust', \"Delighted with his discovery he left the cave,\\nreplaced the slab, and having finished cutting down the tree waited\\nfor the gardener's return\", 'The gardener had heard the night before that the ship about which he\\nwas inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not being yet\\nknown he had been told to return next day for further information', 'He had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with good news\\nbeaming in his face', '\"My son,\" said he, \"rejoice and hold yourself ready to start\\nin three days\" time', 'The ship is to set sail, and I have arranged\\nall about your passage with the captain\\n\\n\"You could not bring me better news,\" replied Camaralzaman,\\n\"and in return I have something pleasant to tell you', 'Follow me\\nand see the good fortune which has befallen you', '\"\\n\\nHe then led the gardener to the cave, and having shown him the\\ntreasure stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heaven\\nshould in this way reward his kind host\\'s many virtues and compensate\\nhim for the privations of many years', '\"What do you mean', '\" asked the gardener', '\"Do you imagine that I should\\nappropriate this treasure', 'It is yours, and I have no right whatever\\nto it', 'For the last eighty years I have dug up the ground here without\\ndiscovering anything', 'It is clear that these riches are intended\\nfor you, and they are much more needed by a prince like yourself\\nthan by an old man like me, who am near my end and require nothing', 'This treasure comes just at the right time, when you are about\\nto return to your own country, where you will make good use of it', '\"\\n\\nBut the prince would not hear of this suggestion, and finally\\nafter much discussion they agreed to divide the gold', 'When this\\nwas done the gardener said:\\n\\n\"My son, the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carry\\noff this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it', 'There are no olives in the Ebony Island, and those imported from\\nhere fetch a high price', 'As you know, I have a good stock of the\\nolives which grew in this garden', 'Now you must take fifty jars,\\nfill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives', 'We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark', '\"\\n\\nThe prince took this advice, and spent the rest of the day filling\\nthe fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman might slip\\nfrom his arm and be lost again, he took the precaution of putting\\nit in one of the jars, on which he made a mark so as to be able\\nto recognise it', 'When night came the jars were all ready,\\nand the prince and his host went to bed', 'Whether in consequence of his great age, or of the fatigues and excitement\\nof the previous day, I do not know, but the gardener passed a very\\nbad night', 'He was worse next day, and by the morning of the third day was\\ndangerously ill', \"At daybreak the ship's captain and some of his sailors\\nknocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger who was to embark\", '\"I am he,\" said Camaralzaman, who had opened the door', '\"The gardener who took my passage is ill and cannot see you,\\nbut please come in and take these jars of olives and my bag,\\nand I will follow as soon as I have taken leave of him', '\"\\n\\nThe sailors did as he asked, and the captain before leaving charged\\nCamaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and he wished\\nto set sail at once', 'As soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottage\\nto bid farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once more\\nfor all his kindness', 'But the old man was at his last gasp,\\nand had barely murmured his confession of faith when he expired', 'Camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the last offices,\\nso having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man up\\nand buried him', 'He then locked the door, gave up the key to the owner\\nof the garden, and hurried to the quay only to hear that the ship\\nhad sailed long ago, after waiting three hours for him', 'It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at this\\nfresh misfortune, which obliged him to spend another year in a strange\\nand distasteful country', \"Moreover, he had once more lost the Princess\\nBadoura's talisman, which he feared he might never see again\", 'There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old man\\nhad done, and to live on in the cottage', 'As he could not well cultivate\\nthe garden by himself, he engaged a lad to help him, and to secure\\nthe rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty more\\njars, filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport', 'Whilst the prince was settling down to this second year of toil\\nand privation, the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived safely\\nat the Ebony Island', 'As the palace of the new king, or rather of the Princess Badoura,\\noverlooked the harbour, she saw the ship entering it and asked what\\nvessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags, and was told\\nthat it was a ship from the Island of the Idolaters which yearly\\nbrought rich merchandise', 'The princess, ever on the look out for any chance of news of her\\nbeloved husband, went down to the harbour attended by some officers\\nof the court, and arrived just as the captain was landing', 'She sent for\\nhim and asked many questions as to his country, voyage, what passengers\\nhe had, and what his vessel was laden with', 'The captain answered all\\nher questions, and said that his passengers consisted entirely of traders\\nwho brought rich stuffs from various countries, fine muslins, precious\\nstones, musk, amber, spices, drugs, olives, and many other things', 'As soon as he mentioned olives, the princess, who was very partial\\nto them, exclaimed:\\n\\n\"I will take all you have on board', 'Have them unloaded and we\\nwill make our bargain at once, and tell the other merchants to let\\nme see all their best wares before showing them to other people', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the captain, \"I have on board fifty very large\\npots of olives', 'They belong to a merchant who was left behind,\\nas in spite of waiting for him he delayed so long that I was obliged\\nto set sail without him', '\"\\n\\n\"Never mind,\" said the princess, \"unload them all the same, and we\\nwill arrange the price', '\"\\n\\nThe captain accordingly sent his boat off to the ship and it soon\\nreturned laden with the fifty pots of olives', 'The princess asked\\nwhat they might be worth', '\"Sire,\" replied the captain, \"the merchant is very poor', 'Your Majesty\\nwill not overpay him if you give him a thousand pieces of silver', '\"\\n\\n\"In order to satisfy him and as he is so poor,\" said the princess,\\n\"I will order a thousand pieces of gold to be given you, which you\\nwill be sure to remit to him', '\"\\n\\nSo saying she gave orders for the payment and returned to the palace,\\nhaving the jars carried before her', 'When evening came the Princess\\nBadoura retired to the inner part of the palace, and going to the\\napartments of the Princess Haiatelnefous she had the fifty jars\\nof olives brought to her', 'She opened one to let her friend taste\\nthe olives and to taste them herself, but great was her surprise when,\\non pouring some into a dish, she found them all powdered with\\ngold dust', '\"What an adventure', 'how extraordinary', '\" she cried', 'Then she had the other jars opened, and was more and more surprised\\nto find the olives in each jar mixed with gold dust', 'But when at length her talisman was discovered in one of the jars\\nher emotion was so great that she fainted away', 'The Princess\\nHaiatelnefous and her women hastened to restore her, and as soon\\nas she recovered consciousness she covered the precious talisman\\nwith kisses', 'Then, dismissing the attendants, she said to her friend:\\n\\n\"You will have guessed, my dear, that it was the sight of this\\ntalisman which has moved me so deeply', 'This was the cause\\nof my separation from my dear husband, and now, I am convinced,\\nit will be the means of our reunion', '\"\\n\\nAs soon as it was light next day the Princess Badoura sent\\nfor the captain, and made further inquiries about the merchant\\nwho owned the olive jars she had bought', 'In reply the captain told her all he knew of the place where the\\nyoung man lived, and how, after engaging his passage, he came\\nto be left behind', '\"If that is the case,\" said the princess, \"you must set sail\\nat once and go back for him', 'He is a debtor of mine and must be\\nbrought here at once, or I will confiscate all your merchandise', 'I shall now give orders to have all the warehouses where your cargo\\nis placed under the royal seal, and they will only be opened when you\\nhave brought me the man I ask for', 'Go at once and obey my orders', '\"\\n\\nThe captain had no choice but to do as he was bid, so hastily\\nprovisioning his ship he started that same evening on his return voyage', \"When, after a rapid passage, he gained sight of the Island of Idolaters,\\nhe judged it better not to enter the harbour, but casting anchor\\nat some distance he embarked at night in a small boat with six\\nactive sailors and landed near Camaralzaman's cottage\", 'The prince was not asleep, and as he lay awake moaning over\\nall the sad events which had separated him from his wife,\\nhe thought he heard a knock at the garden door', 'He went to\\nopen it, and was immediately seized by the captain and sailors,\\nwho without a word of explanation forcibly bore him off to\\nthe boat, which took them back to the ship without loss of time', 'No sooner were they on board than they weighed anchor and set sail', 'Camaralzaman, who had kept silence till then, now asked the captain\\n(whom he had recognised) the reason for this abduction', '\"Are you not a debtor of the King of the Ebony Island', '\" asked the captain', '\"I', 'Why, I never even heard of him before, and never set foot\\nin his kingdom', '\" was the answer', '\"Well, you must know better than I,\" said the captain', '\"You will soon\\nsee him now, and meantime be content where you are and have patience', '\"\\n\\nThe return voyage was as prosperous as the former one, and though\\nit was night when the ship entered the harbour, the captain lost no\\ntime in landing with his passenger, whom he conducted to the palace,\\nwhere he begged an audience with the king', 'Directly the Princess Badoura saw the prince she recognised him in\\nspite of his shabby clothes', 'She longed to throw herself on his neck,\\nbut restrained herself, feeling it was better for them both that\\nshe should play her part a little longer', 'She therefore desired\\none of her officers to take care of him and to treat him well', 'Next she ordered another officer to remove the seals from the warehouse,\\nwhilst she presented the captain with a costly diamond, and told\\nhim to keep the thousand pieces of gold paid for the olives,\\nas she would arrange matters with the merchant himself', 'She then returned to her private apartments, where she told the\\nPrincess Haiatelnefous all that had happened, as well as her plans for\\nthe future, and begged her assistance, which her friend readily promised', 'Next morning she ordered the prince to be taken to the bath and\\nclothed in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a province', 'He was then introduced to the council, where his good looks and grand\\nair drew the attention of all on him', 'Princess Badoura, delighted to see him looking himself once more,\\nturned to the other emirs, saying:\\n\\n\"My lords, I introduce to you a new colleague, Camaralzaman, whom I\\nhave known on my travels and who, I can assure you, you will find\\nwell deserves your regard and admiration', '\"\\n\\nCamaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the king--whom he never\\nsuspected of being a woman in disguise--asserting their acquaintance,\\nfor he felt sure he had never seen her before', 'However he\\nreceived all the praises bestowed on him with becoming modesty,\\nand prostrating himself, said:\\n\\n\"Sire, I cannot find words in which to thank your Majesty\\nfor the great honour conferred on me', 'I can but assure\\nyou that I will do all in my power to prove myself worthy of it', '\"\\n\\nOn leaving the council the prince was conducted to a splendid house\\nwhich had been prepared for him, where he found a full establishment\\nand well-filled stables at his orders', 'On entering his study his\\nsteward presented him with a coffer filled with gold pieces for his\\ncurrent expenses', 'He felt more and more puzzled by such good fortune,\\nand little guessed that the Princess of China was the cause of it', 'After a few days the Princess Badoura promoted Camaralzaman to the\\npost of grand treasurer, an office which he filled with so much\\nintegrity and benevolence as to win universal esteem', 'He would now have thought himself the happiest of men had it not\\nbeen for that separation which he never ceased to bewail', 'He had\\nno clue to the mystery of his present position, for the princess,\\nout of compliment to the old king, had taken his name, and was\\ngenerally known as King Armanos the younger, few people remembering\\nthat on her first arrival she went by another name', \"At length the princess felt that the time had come to put an end\\nto her own and the prince's suspense, and having arranged all her\\nplans with the Princess Haiatelnefous, she informed Camaralzaman\\nthat she wished his advice on some important business, and, to avoid\\nbeing disturbed, desired him to come to the palace that evening\", 'The prince was punctual, and was received in the private apartment,\\nwhen, having ordered her attendants to withdraw, the princess took\\nfrom a small box the talisman, and, handing it to Camaralzaman,\\nsaid:  \"Not long ago an astrologer gave me this talisman', 'As you\\nare universally well informed, you can perhaps tell me what is its use', '\"\\n\\nCamaralzaman took the talisman and, holding it to the light,\\ncried with surprise, \"Sire, you ask me the use of this talisman', 'Alas', 'hitherto it has been only a source of misfortune to me,\\nbeing the cause of my separation from the one I love best on earth', 'The story is so sad and strange that I am sure your Majesty will be\\ntouched by it if you will permit me to tell it you', '\"\\n\\n\"I will hear it some other time,\" replied the princess', '\"Meanwhile I fancy it is not quite unknown to me', 'Wait here for me', 'I will return shortly', '\"\\n\\nSo saying she retired to another room, where she hastily changed\\nher masculine attire for that of a woman, and, after putting on\\nthe girdle she wore the day they parted, returned to Camaralzaman', 'The prince recognised her at once, and, embracing her with the\\nutmost tenderness, cried, \"Ah, how can I thank the king for this\\ndelightful surprise', '\"\\n\\n\"Do not expect ever to see the king again,\" said the princess,\\nas she wiped the tears of joy from her eyes, \"in me you see the king', 'Let us sit down, and I will tell you all about it', '\"\\n\\nShe then gave a full account of all her adventures since their parting,\\nand dwelt much on the charms and noble disposition of the\\nPrincess Haiatelnefous, to whose friendly assistance she owed\\nso much', \"When she had done she asked to hear the prince's story,\\nand in this manner they spent most of the night\", \"Next morning the princess resumed her woman's clothes, and as soon\\nas she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg King Armanos\\nto come to her apartments\", 'When the king arrived great was his surprise at finding a strange\\nlady in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual right to\\nenter the private apartment', 'Seating himself he asked for the king', '\"Sire,\" said the princess, \"yesterday I was the king, to-day I am\\nonly the Princess of China and wife to the real Prince Camaralzaman,\\nson of King Schahzaman, and I trust that when your Majesty shall\\nhave heard our story you will not condemn the innocent deception I\\nhave been obliged to practise', '\"\\n\\nThe king consented to listen, and did so with marked surprise', 'At the close of her narrative the princess said, \"Sire, as our religion\\nallows a man to have more than one wife, I would beg your Majesty\\nto give your daughter, the Princess Haiatelnefous, in marriage\\nto Prince Camaralzaman', 'I gladly yield to her the precedence and\\ntitle of Queen in recognition of the debt of gratitude which I owe her', '\"\\n\\nKing Armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration,\\nthen, turning to Camaralzaman, he said, \"My son, as your wife,\\nthe Princess Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law),\\nconsents to share your hand and affections with my daughter,\\nI have only to ask if this marriage is agreeable to you, and if you\\nwill consent to accept the crown which the Princess Badoura deserves\\nto wear all her life, but which she prefers to resign for love of you', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied Camaralzaman, \"I can refuse your Majesty nothing', '\"\\n\\nAccordingly Camaralzaman was duly proclaimed king, and as duly\\nmarried with all pomp to the Princess Haiatelnefous, with whose\\nbeauty, talents, and affections he had every reason to be pleased', 'The two queens lived in true sisterly harmony together, and after\\na time each presented King Camaralzaman with a son, whose births\\nwere celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost rejoicing', 'Noureddin and the Fair Persian\\n\\n\\nBalsora was the capital of a kingdom long tributary to the caliph', 'During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the king of Balsora,\\nwho was his cousin, was called Zinebi', 'Not thinking one vizir enough\\nfor the administration of his estates he had two, named Khacan\\nand Saouy', 'Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took pleasure\\nin obliging, as far as in him lay, those who had business with him', 'Throughout the entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteem\\nand praise him as he deserved', 'Saouy was quite a different character, and repelled everyone with\\nwhom he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in spite of his\\ngreat riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the necessaries\\nof life', 'What made him particularly detested was the great aversion\\nhe had to Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king', 'One day, while the king amused himself talking with his two\\nvizirs and other members of the council, the conversation turned\\non female slaves', 'While some declared that it sufficed for a\\nslave to be beautiful, others, and Khacan was among the number,\\nmaintained that beauty alone was not enough, but that it must\\nbe accompanied by wit, wisdom, modesty, and, if possible, knowledge', 'The king not only declared himself to be of this opinion, but charged\\nKhacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these conditions', 'Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was jealous of the\\nhonour done to Khacan, said, \"Sire, it will be very difficult to find\\na slave as accomplished as your Majesty desires, and, if she is\\nto be found, she will be cheap if she cost less than 10,000 gold pieces', '\"\\n\\n\"Saouy,\" answered the king, \"you seem to find that a very great sum', 'For you it may be so, but not for me', '\"\\n\\nAnd forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer, who was present,\\nto send 10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the slave', 'As soon, then, as Khacan returned home he sent for the dealers in\\nfemale slaves, and charged them directly they had found such a one\\nas he described to inform him', 'They promised to do their utmost,\\nand no day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspection\\nbut none was found without some defect', \"At length, early one morning, while Khacan was on his way to the\\nking's palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way, announced eagerly\\nthat a Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening, had a\\nslave to sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty\", 'Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that the slave should\\nbe brought for his inspection on his return from the palace', 'The dealer appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slave\\nbeautiful beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the name\\nof \"The Fair Persian', '\"\\n\\nBeing a man of great wisdom and learning, he perceived in the short\\nconversation he had with her that he would seek in vain another\\nslave to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king,\\nand therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant put upon her', '\"Sir,\" was the answer, \"for less than 10,000 gold pieces he will not\\nlet her go; he declares that, what with masters for her instruction,\\nand for bodily exercises, not to speak of clothing and nourishment,\\nhe has already spent that sum upon her', 'She is in every way fit to be\\nthe slave of a king; she plays every musical instrument, she sings,\\nshe dances, she makes verses, in fact there is no accomplishment\\nin which she does not excel', '\"\\n\\nKhacan, who was better able to judge of her merits than the dealer,\\nwishing to bring the matter to a conclusion, sent for the merchant,\\nand said to him, \"It is not for myself that I wish to buy your slave,\\nbut for the king', 'Her price, however, is too high', '\"\\n\\n\"Sir,\" replied the merchant, \"I should esteem it an honour to present\\nher to his Majesty, did it become a merchant to do such a thing', 'I ask no more than the sum it has cost me to make her such as she is', '\"\\n\\nKhacan, not wishing to bargain, immediately had the sum counted out,\\nand given to the merchant, who before withdrawing said:\\n\\n\"Sir, as she is destined for the king, I would have you observe\\nthat she is extremely tired with the long journey, and before\\npresenting her to his Majesty you would do well to keep her\\na fortnight in your own house, and to see that a little care is\\nbestowed upon her', 'The sun has tanned her complexion, but when she\\nhas been two or three times to the bath, and is fittingly dressed,\\nyou will see how much her beauty will be increased', '\"\\n\\nKhacan thanked the merchant for his advice, and determined to follow it', 'He gave the beautiful Persian an apartment near to that of his wife,\\nwhom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady destined for the king,\\nand to order for her the most magnificent garments', 'Before bidding adieu to the fair Persian, he said to her: \\n\"No happiness can be greater than what I have procured for you;\\njudge for yourself, you now belong to the king', 'I have, however, to warn\\nyou of one thing', 'I have a son, who, though not wanting in sense,\\nis young, foolish, and headstrong, and I charge you to keep him\\nat a distance', '\"\\n\\nThe Persian thanked him for his advice, and promised to profit\\nby it', \"Noureddin--for so the vizir's son was named--went freely in and out\\nof his mother's apartments\", 'He was young, well-made and agreeable,\\nand had the gift of charming all with whom he came in contact', 'As soon as he saw the beautiful Persian, though aware that she was\\ndestined for the king, he let himself be carried away by her charms,\\nand determined at once to use every means in his power to retain\\nher for himself', 'The Persian was equally captivated by Noureddin,\\nand said to herself:  \"The vizir does me too great honour in buying me\\nfor the king', 'I should esteem myself very happy if he would give me\\nto his son', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin availed himself of every opportunity to gaze upon her beauty,\\nto talk and laugh with her, and never would have left her side\\nif his mother had not forced him', \"Some time having elapsed, on account of the long journey, since the\\nbeautiful Persian had been to the bath, five or six days after her\\npurchase the vizir's wife gave orders that the bath should be heated\\nfor her, and that her own female slaves should attend her there,\\nand after-wards should array her in a magnificent dress that had\\nbeen prepared for her\", \"Her toilet completed, the beautiful Persian came to present herself\\nto the vizir's wife, who hardly recognised her, so greatly was her\\nbeauty increased\", 'Kissing her hand, the beautiful slave said: \\n\"Madam, I do not know how you find me in this dress that you\\nhave had prepared for me; your women assure me that it suits me\\nso well that they hardly knew me', 'If it is the truth they tell me,\\nand not flattery, it is to you I owe the transformation', '\"\\n\\n\"My daughter,\" answered the vizir\\'s wife, \"they do not flatter you', 'I myself hardly recognised you', 'The improvement is not due to the\\ndress alone, but largely to the beautifying effects of the bath', 'I am so struck by its results, that I would try it on myself', '\"\\n\\nActing forthwith on this decision she ordered two little slaves\\nduring her absence to watch over the beautiful Persian, and not\\nto allow Noureddin to enter should he come', 'She had no sooner gone than he arrived, and not finding his mother\\nin her apartment, would have sought her in that of the Persian', 'The two little slaves barred the entrance, saying that his mother had\\ngiven orders that he was not to be admitted', 'Taking each by an arm,\\nhe put them out of the anteroom, and shut the door', 'Then they\\nrushed to the bath, informing their mistress with shrieks and tears\\nthat Noureddin had driven them away by force and gone in', 'This news caused great consternation to the lady, who, dressing\\nherself as quickly as possible, hastened to the apartment of\\nthe fair Persian, to find that Noureddin had already gone out', \"Much astonished to see the vizir's wife enter in tears,\\nthe Persian asked what misfortune had happened\", '\"What', '\" exclaimed the lady, \"you ask me that, knowing that my son\\nNoureddin has been alone with you', '\"\\n\\n\"But, madam,\" inquired the Persian, \"what harm is there in that', '\"\\n\\n\"How', 'Has my husband not told you that you are destined for the king', '\"\\n\\n\"Certainly, but Noureddin has just been to tell me that his father\\nhas changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him', 'I believed him,\\nand so great is my affection for Noureddin that I would willingly\\npass my life with him', '\"\\n\\n\"Would to heaven,\" exclaimed the wife of the vizir, \"that what you\\nsay were true; but Noureddin has deceived you, and his father\\nwill sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has done', '\"\\n\\nSo saying, she wept bitterly, and all her slaves wept with her', 'Khacan, entering shortly after this, was much astonished to find his wife\\nand her slaves in tears, and the beautiful Persian greatly perturbed', 'He inquired the cause, but for some time no answer was forthcoming', 'When his wife was at length sufficiently calm to inform him\\nof what had happened, his rage and mortification knew no bounds', 'Wringing his hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed:\\n\\n\"Wretched son', 'thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father', 'The king will shed not only thy blood but mine', '\"  His wife tried\\nto console him, saying:  \"Do not torment thyself', 'With the sale\\nof my jewels I will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum you\\nwill buy another slave', '\"\\n\\n\"Do not suppose,\" replied her husband, \"that it is the loss of the money\\nthat affects me', 'My honour is at stake, and that is more precious\\nto me than all my wealth', 'You know that Saouy is my mortal enemy', 'He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the consequences\\nthat will ensue', '\"\\n\\n\"My lord,\" said his wife, \"I am quite aware of Saouy\\'s baseness,\\nand that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick', 'But how can he or any one else know what takes place in this house', 'Even if you are suspected and the king accuses you, you have only\\nto say that, after examining the slave, you did not find her worthy\\nof his Majesty', 'Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers,\\nsaying that you are not satisfied, and wish them to find you\\nanother slave', '\"\\n\\nThis advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided to follow it,\\nbut his wrath against his son did not abate', 'Noureddin dared\\nnot appear all that day, and fearing to take refuge with his\\nusual associates in case his father should seek him there,\\nhe spent the day in a secluded garden where he was not known', 'He did not return home till after his father had gone to bed,\\nand went out early next morning before the vizir awoke, and these\\nprecautions he kept up during an entire month', 'His mother, though knowing very well that he returned to the house\\nevery evening, dare not ask her husband to pardon him', 'At length\\nshe took courage and said:\\n\\n\"My lord, I know that a son could not act more basely towards\\nhis father than Noureddin has done towards you, but after\\nall will you now pardon him', 'Do you not consider the harm\\nyou may be doing yourself, and fear that malicious people,\\nseeking the cause of your estrangement, may guess the real one', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" replied the vizir, \"what you say is very just, but I cannot\\npardon Noureddin before I have mortified him as he deserves', '\"\\n\\n\"He will be sufficiently punished,\" answered the lady, \"if you do\\nas I suggest', 'In the evening, when he returns home, lie in wait\\nfor him and pretend that you will slay him', 'I will come to his aid,\\nand while pointing out that you only yield his life at my supplications,\\nyou can force him to take the beautiful Persian on any conditions\\nyou please', '\"  Khacan agreed to follow this plan, and everything\\ntook place as arranged', 'On Noureddin\\'s return Khacan pretended\\nto be about to slay him, but yielding to his wife\\'s intercession,\\nsaid to his son:\\n\\n\"You owe your life to your mother', 'I pardon you on her intercession,\\nand on the conditions that you take the beautiful Persian for your wife,\\nand not your slave, that you never sell her, nor put her away', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin, not hoping for so great indulgence, thanked his father,\\nand vowed to do as he desired', \"Khacan was at great pains frequently\\nto speak to the king of the difficulties attending the commission he\\nhad given him, but some whispers of what had actually taken place\\ndid reach Saouy's ears\", 'More than a year after these events the minister took a chill,\\nleaving the bath while still heated to go out on important business', 'This resulted in inflammation of the lungs, which rapidly increased', 'The vizir, feeling that his end was at hand, sent for Noureddin,\\nand charged him with his dying breath never to part with the\\nbeautiful Persian', 'Shortly afterwards he expired, leaving universal regret throughout\\nthe kingdom; rich and poor alike followed him to the grave', \"Noureddin showed every mark of the deepest grief at his father's death,\\nand for long refused to see any one\", 'At length a day came when,\\none of his friends being admitted, urged him strongly to be consoled,\\nand to resume his former place in society', 'This advice Noureddin\\nwas not slow to follow, and soon he formed little society of ten\\nyoung men all about his own age, with whom he spent all his time in\\ncontinual feasting and merry-making', 'Sometimes the fair Persian consented to appear at these festivities,\\nbut she disapproved of this lavish expenditure, and did not scruple\\nto warn Noureddin of the probable consequences', 'He, however, only\\nlaughed at her advice, saying, that his father had always kept him in\\ntoo great constraint, and that now he rejoiced at his new-found liberty', 'What added to the confusion in his affairs was that he refused\\nto look into his accounts with his steward, sending him away every\\ntime he appeared with his book', '\"See only that I live well,\" he said, \"and do not disturb me about\\nanything else', '\"\\n\\nNot only did Noureddin\\'s friends constantly partake of his hospitality,\\nbut in every way they took advantage of his generosity; everything of\\nhis that they admired, whether land, houses, baths, or any\\nother source of his revenue, he immediately bestowed on them', 'In vain the Persian protested against the wrong he did himself;\\nhe continued to scatter with the same lavish hand', 'Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing but amuse himself,\\nand dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to acquire', 'The year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat at table,\\nthere came a knock at the door', 'The slaves having been sent away,\\nNoureddin went to open it himself', 'One of his friends had risen at\\nthe same time, but Noureddin was before him, and finding the intruder\\nto be the steward, he went out and closed the door', 'The friend,\\ncurious to hear what passed between them, hid himself behind the hangings,\\nand heard the following words:\\n\\n\"My lord,\" said the steward, \"I beg a thousand pardons for\\ninterrupting you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place', 'Nothing remains of the sums you gave me for your expenses, and all\\nother sources of income are also at end, having been transferred\\nby you to others', 'If you wish me to remain in your service,\\nfurnish me with the necessary funds, else I must withdraw', '\"\\n\\nSo great was Noureddin\\'s consternation that he had not a word\\nto say in reply', 'The friend, who had been listening behind the curtain, immediately\\nhastened to communicate the news to the rest of the company', '\"If this is so,\" they said, \"we must cease to come here', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin re-entering at that moment, they plainly saw, in spite\\nof his efforts to dissemble, that what they had heard was the truth', 'One by one they rose, and each with a different excuse left the room,\\ntill presently he found himself alone, though little suspecting the\\nresolution his friends had taken', 'Then, seeing the beautiful Persian,\\nhe confided to her the statement of the steward, with many expressions\\nof regret for his own carelessness', '\"Had I but followed your advice, beautiful Persian,\" he said,\\n\"all this would not have happened, but at least I have this consolation,\\nthat I have spent my fortune in the company of friends who will\\nnot desert me in an hour of need', 'To-morrow I will go to them,\\nand amongst them they will lend me a sum sufficient to start\\nin some business', '\"\\n\\nAccordingly next morning early Noureddin went to seek his ten friends,\\nwho all lived in the same street', 'Knocking at the door of the first\\nand chief, the slave who opened it left him to wait in a hall while\\nhe announced his visit to his master', '\"Noureddin', '\" he heard him\\nexclaim quite audibly', '\"Tell him, every time he calls, that I am\\nnot at home', '\"  The same thing happened at the second door, and also at\\nthe third, and so on with all the ten', 'Noureddin, much mortified,\\nrecognised too late that he had confided in false friends,\\nwho abandoned him in his hour of need', 'Overwhelmed with grief,\\nhe sought consolation from the beautiful Persian', '\"Alas, my lord,\" she said, \"at last you are convinced of the truth\\nof what I foretold', 'There is now no other resource left but to sell\\nyour slaves and your furniture', '\"\\n\\nFirst then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for a time on the proceeds,\\nafter that the furniture was sold, and as much of it was valuable it\\nsufficed for some time', 'Finally this resource also came to an end,\\nand again he sought counsel from the beautiful Persian', '\"My lord,\" she said, \"I know that the late vizir, your father,\\nbought me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I have diminished\\nin value since, I should still fetch a large sum', 'Do not therefore\\nhesitate to sell me, and with the money you obtain go and establish\\nyourself in business in some distant town', '\"\\n\\n\"Charming Persian,\" answered Noureddin, \"how could I be guilty\\nof such baseness', 'I would die rather than part from you whom\\nI love better than my life', '\"\\n\\n\"My lord,\" she replied, \"I am well aware of your love for me,\\nwhich is only equalled by mine for you, but a cruel necessity\\nobliges us to seek the only remedy', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin, convinced at length of the truth of her words, yielded,\\nand reluctantly led her to the slave market, where, showing her\\nto a dealer named Hagi Hassan, he inquired her value', 'Taking them into a room apart, Hagi Hassan exclaimed as soon as she\\nhad unveiled, \"My lord, is not this the slave your father bought\\nfor 10,000 pieces', '\"\\n\\nOn learning that it was so, he promised to obtain the highest possible\\nprice for her', 'Leaving the beautiful Persian shut up in the room alone,\\nhe went out to seek the slave merchants, announcing to them that he\\nhad found the pearl among slaves, and asking them to come and put\\na value upon her', 'As soon as they saw her they agreed that less\\nthan 4,000 gold pieces could not be asked', 'Hagi Hassan, then closing\\nthe door upon her, began to offer her for sale--calling out: \\n\"Who will bid 4,000 gold pieces for the Persian slave', '\"\\n\\nBefore any of the merchants had bid, Saouy happened to pass that way,\\nand judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary beauty, rode up\\nto Hagi Hassan and desired to see her', 'Now it was not the custom\\nto show a slave to a private bidder, but as no one dared to disobey\\nthe vizir his request was granted', 'As soon as Saouy saw the Persian he was so struck by her beauty,\\nthat he immediately wished to possess her, and not knowing that she\\nbelonged to Noureddin, he desired Hagi Hassan to send for the owner\\nand to conclude the bargain at once', 'Hagi Hassan then sought Noureddin, and told him that his slave\\nwas going far below her value, and that if Saouy bought her he\\nwas capable of not paying the money', '\"What you must do,\" he said,\\n\"is to pretend that you had no real intention of selling your slave,\\nand only swore you would in a fit of anger against her', 'When I\\npresent her to Saouy as if with your consent you must step in,\\nand with blows begin to lead her away', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin did as Hagi Hassan advised, to the great wrath of Saouy,\\nwho riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful Persian\\nfrom him by force', \"Noureddin letting her go, seized Saouy's horse\\nby the bridle, and, encouraged by the applause of the bystanders,\\ndragged him to the ground, beat him severely, and left him in the\\ngutter streaming with blood\", 'Then, taking the beautiful Persian,\\nhe returned home amidst the acclamations of the people, who detested\\nSaouy so much that they would neither interfere in his behalf nor\\nallow his slaves to protect him', 'Covered from head to foot with mire and streaming with blood he rose,\\nand leaning on two of his slaves went straight to the palace,\\nwhere he demanded an audience of the king, to whom he related what\\nhad taken place in these words:\\n\\n\"May it please your Majesty, I had gone to the slave market to buy myself\\na cook', 'While there I heard a slave being offered for 4,000 pieces', 'Asking to see her, I found she was of incomparable beauty,\\nand was being sold by Noureddin, the son of your late vizir,\\nto whom your Majesty will remember giving a sum of 10,000 gold\\npieces for the purchase of a slave', 'This is the identical slave,\\nwhom instead of bringing to your Majesty he gave to his own son', 'Since the death of his father this Noureddin has run through his\\nentire fortune, has sold all his possessions, and is now reduced\\nto selling the slave', 'Calling him to me, I said:  \"Noureddin, I\\nwill give you 10,000 gold pieces for your slave, whom I will present\\nto the king', 'I will interest him at the same time in your behalf,\\nand this will be worth much more to you than what extra money you\\nmight obtain from the merchants', '\"  \"Bad old man,\" he exclaimed,\\n\"rather than sell my slave to you I would give her to a Jew', '\" \\n\"But, Noureddin,\" I remonstrated, \"you do not consider that in speaking\\nthus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed everything', '\" \\nThis remonstrance only irritated him the more', \"Throwing himself on me\\nlike a madman, he tore me from my horse, beat me to his heart's content,\\nand left me in the state your Majesty sees\", '\"\\n\\nSo saying Saouy turned aside his head and wept bitterly', \"The king's wrath was kindled against Noureddin\", \"He ordered the captain\\nof the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage Noureddin's house,\\nto rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the slave to him\", \"A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan's,\\nhearing this order given, slipped out of the king's apartment,\\nand hastened to warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with the\\nbeautiful Persian\", 'Then, presenting him with forty gold pieces,\\nhe disappeared before Noureddin had time to thank him', 'As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on her veil they\\nfled together, and had the good fortune to get out of the town\\nwithout being observed', 'At the mouth of the Euphrates they\\nfound a ship just about to start for Bagdad', 'They embarked,\\nand immediately the anchor was raised and they set sail', \"When the captain of the guard reached Noureddin's house he caused his\\nsoldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force, but no trace was\\nto be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could the neighbours give\\nany information about them\", 'When the king heard that they had escaped,\\nhe issued a proclamation that a reward of 1,000 gold pieces would be\\ngiven to whoever would bring him Noureddin and the slave, but that,\\non the contrary, whoever hid them would be severely punished', 'Meanwhile Noureddin and the fair Persian had safely reached Bagdad', 'When the vessel had come to an anchor they paid five gold pieces for\\ntheir passage and went ashore', 'Never having been in Bagdad before,\\nthey did not know where to seek a lodging', 'Wandering along the banks\\nof the Tigris, they skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall', 'The gate was shut, but in front of it was an open vestibule with a sofa\\non either side', '\"Here,\" said Noureddin, \"let us pass the night,\"\\nand reclining on the sofas they soon fell asleep', 'Now this garden belonged to the Caliph', 'In the middle of it was\\na vast pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each window\\nhaving a lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there', 'Only the door-keeper lived there, an old soldier named Scheih Ibrahim,\\nwho had strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted,\\nand never to allow any one to sit on the sofas by the door', 'It happened that evening that he had gone out on an errand', 'When he came back and saw two persons asleep on the sofas he was\\nabout to drive them out with blows, but drawing nearer he perceived\\nthat they were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman,\\nand decided to awake them by gentler means', 'Noureddin, on being awoke,\\ntold the old man that they were strangers, and merely wished to pass\\nthe night there', '\"Come with me,\" said Scheih Ibrahim, \"I will lodge\\nyou better, and will show you a magnificent garden belonging to me', '\" \\nSo saying the doorkeeper led the way into the Caliph\\'s garden,\\nthe beauties of which filled them with wonder and amazement', 'Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to Scheih Ibrahim\\nsaid\\n\\n\"I beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry together', '\" \\nBeing very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim determined to spend only\\nthe tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to himself', 'While he was gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered through the\\ngardens and went up the white marble staircase of the pavilion as far\\nas the locked door of the saloon', 'On the return of Scheih Ibrahim\\nthey begged him to open it, and to allow them to enter and admire\\nthe magnificence within', 'Consenting, he brought not only the key,\\nbut a light, and immediately unlocked the door', 'Noureddin and the\\nPersian entering, were dazzled with the magnificence they beheld', 'The paintings and furniture were of astonishing beauty, and between\\neach window was a silver arm holding a candle', 'Scheih Ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa, and all\\nthree ate together', 'When they had finished eating Noureddin\\nasked the old man to bring them a bottle of wine', '\"Heaven forbid,\" said Scheih Ibrahim, \"that I should come in contact\\nwith wine', 'I who have four times made the pilgrimage to Mecca,\\nand have renounced wine for ever', '\"\\n\\n\"You would, however, do us a great service in procuring\\nus some,\" said Noureddin', '\"You need not touch it yourself', \"Take the ass which is tied to the gate, lead it to the nearest\\nwine-shop, and ask some passer-by to order two jars of wine;\\nhave them put in the ass's panniers, and drive him before you\", 'Here are two pieces of gold for the expenses', '\"\\n\\nAt sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at once to execute\\nthe commission', 'On his return, Noureddin said:  \"We have still need\\nof cups to drink from, and of fruit, if you can procure us some', '\" \\nScheih Ibrahim disappeared again, and soon returned with a table spread\\nwith cups of gold and silver, and every sort of beautiful fruit', 'Then he withdrew, in spite of repeated invitations to remain', 'Noureddin and the beautiful Persian, finding the wine excellent,\\ndrank of it freely, and while drinking they sang', 'Both had fine\\nvoices, and Scheih Ibrahim listened to them with great pleasure--\\nfirst from a distance, then he drew nearer, and finally put his\\nhead in at the door', 'Noureddin, seeing him, called to him to come\\nin and keep them company', 'At first the old man declined, but was\\npersuaded to enter the room, to sit down on the edge of the sofa\\nnearest the door, and at last to draw closer and to seat himself\\nby the beautiful Persian, who urged him so persistently to drink\\nher health that at length he yielded, and took the cup she offered', 'Now the old man only made a pretence of renouncing wine;\\nhe frequented wine-shops like other people, and had taken none\\nof the precautions Noureddin had proposed', 'Having once yielded,\\nhe was easily persuaded to take a second cup, and a third,\\nand so on till he no longer knew what he was doing', 'Till near\\nmidnight they continued drinking, laughing, and singing together', 'About that time the Persian, perceiving that the room was lit\\nby only one miserable tallow candle, asked Scheih Ibrahim to light\\nsome of the beautiful candles in the silver arms', '\"Light them yourself,\" answered the old man; \"you are younger than I,\\nbut let five or six be enough', '\"\\n\\nShe did not stop, however, till she had lit all the eighty, but Scheih\\nIbrahim was not conscious of this, and when, soon after that,\\nNoureddin proposed to have some of the lustres lit, he answered:\\n\\n\"You are more capable of lighting them than I, but not more than three', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin, far from contenting himself with three, lit all,\\nand opened all the eighty windows', 'The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, chancing at that moment to open\\na window in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden,\\nwas surprised to see the pavilion brilliantly illuminated', 'Calling the grand-vizir, Giafar, he said to him:\\n\\n\"Negligent vizir, look at the pavilion, and tell me why it is lit\\nup when I am not there', '\"\\n\\nWhen the vizir saw that it was as the Caliph said, he trembled\\nwith fear, and immediately invented an excuse', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" he said, \"I must tell you that four\\nor five days ago Scheih Ibrahim told me that he wished to have\\nan assembly of the ministers of his mosque, and asked permission\\nto hold it in the pavilion', 'I granted his request, but forgot\\nsince to mention it to your Majesty', '\"\\n\\n\"Giafar,\" replied the Caliph, \"you have committed three faults--\\nfirst, in giving the permission; second, in not mentioning it\\nto me; and third, in not investigating the matter more closely', 'For punishment I condemn you to spend the rest of the night with me\\nin company of these worthy people', 'While I dress myself as a citizen,\\ngo and disguise yourself, and then come with me', '\"\\n\\nWhen they reached the garden gate they found it open, to the great\\nindignation of the Caliph', 'The door of the pavilion being also open,\\nhe went softly upstairs, and looked in at the half-closed door\\nof the saloon', 'Great was his surprise to see Scheih Ibrahim,\\nwhose sobriety he had never doubted, drinking and singing with a young\\nman and a beautiful lady', 'The Caliph, before giving way to his anger,\\ndetermined to watch and see who the people were and what they did', 'Presently Scheih Ibrahim asked the beautiful Persian if anything\\nwere wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening', '\"If only,\" she said, \"I had an instrument upon which I might play', '\"\\n\\nScheih Ibrahim immediately took a lute from a cup-board and gave\\nit to the Persian, who began to play on it, singing the while\\nwith such skill and taste that the Caliph was enchanted', 'When she ceased he went softly downstairs and said to the vizir:\\n\\n\"Never have I heard a finer voice, nor the lute better played', 'I am determined to go in and make her play to me', '\"\\n\\n\"Commander of the Faithful,\" said the vizir, \"if Scheih Ibrahim\\nrecognises you he will die of fright', '\"\\n\\n\"I should be sorry for that,\" answered the Caliph, \"and I am going\\nto take steps to prevent it', 'Wait here till I return', '\"\\n\\nNow the Caliph had caused a bend in the river to form a lake in\\nhis garden', 'There the finest fish in the Tigris were to be found,\\nbut fishing was strictly forbidden', 'It happened that night,\\nhowever, that a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate being\\nopen to go in and cast his nets', 'He was just about to draw them\\nwhen he saw the Caliph approaching', 'Recognising him at once in spite\\nof his disguise, he threw himself at his feet imploring forgiveness', '\"Fear nothing,\" said the Caliph, \"only rise up and draw thy nets', '\"\\n\\nThe fisherman did as he was told, and produced five or six fine fish,\\nof which the Caliph took the two largest', 'Then he desired the\\nfisherman to change clothes with him, and in a few minutes the Caliph\\nwas transformed into a fisherman, even to the shoes and the turban', 'Taking the two fish in his hand, he returned to the vizir, who,\\nnot recognising him, would have sent him about his business', 'Leaving the vizir at the foot of the stairs, the Caliph went up\\nand knocked at the door of the saloon', 'Noureddin opened it,\\nand the Caliph, standing on the threshold, said:\\n\\n\"Scheih Ibrahim, I am the fisher Kerim', 'Seeing that you are feasting\\nwith your friends, I bring you these fish', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin and the Persian said that when the fishes were properly\\ncooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them', \"The Caliph then\\nreturned to the vizir, and they set to work in Scheih Ibrahim's\\nhouse to cook the fish, of which they made so tempting a dish\\nthat Noureddin and the fair Persian ate of it with great relish\", 'When they had finished Noureddin took thirty gold pieces (all\\nthat remained of what Sangiar had given him) and presented them to\\nthe Caliph, who, thanking him, asked as a further favour if the lady\\nwould play him one piece on the lute', 'The Persian gladly consented,\\nand sang and played so as to delight the Caliph', 'Noureddin, in the habit of giving to others whatever they admired,\\nsaid, \"Fisherman, as she pleases you so much, take her; she is yours', '\"\\n\\nThe fair Persian, astounded that he should wish to part from her,\\ntook her lute, and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches to\\nits music', 'The Caliph (still in the character of fisherman) said to him,\\n\"Sir, I perceive that this fair lady is your slave', 'Oblige me,\\nI beg you, by relating your history', '\"\\n\\nNoureddin willingly granted this request, and recounted everything\\nfrom the purchase of the slave down to the present moment', '\"And where do you go now', '\" asked the Caliph', '\"Wherever the hand of Allah leads me,\" said Noureddin', '\"Then, if you will listen to me,\" said the Caliph, \"you will\\nimmediately return to Balsora', 'I will give you a letter to the king,\\nwhich will ensure you a good reception from him', '\"\\n\\n\"It is an unheard-of thing,\" said Noureddin, \"that a fisherman\\nshould be in correspondence with a king', '\"\\n\\n\"Let not that astonish you,\" answered the Caliph; \"we studied together,\\nand have always remained the best of friends, though fortune,\\nwhile making him a king, left me a humble fisherman', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph then took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following letter,\\nat the top of which he put in very small characters this formula\\nto show that he must be implicitly obeyed:--\"In the name of the Most\\nMerciful God', '\"\\n\\n\"Letter of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid to the King of Balsora', '\"\\n\\n\"Haroun-al-Raschid, son of Mahdi, sends this letter to Mohammed Zinebi,\\nhis cousin', 'As soon as Noureddin, son of the Vizir Khacan,\\nbearer of this letter, has given it to thee, and thou hast read it,\\ntake off thy royal mantle, put it on his shoulders, and seat him\\nin thy place without fail', 'Farewell', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph then gave this letter to Noureddin, who immediately\\nset off, with only what little money he possessed when Sangiar\\ncame to his assistance', 'The beautiful Persian, inconsolable at\\nhis departure, sank on a sofa bathed in tears', 'When Noureddin had left the room, Scheih Ibrahim, who had hitherto\\nkept silence, said:  \"Kerim, for two miserable fish thou hast\\nreceived a purse and a slave', 'I tell thee I will take the slave,\\nand as to the purse, if it contains silver thou mayst keep one piece,\\nif gold then I will take all and give thee what copper pieces I\\nhave in my purse', '\"\\n\\nNow here it must be related that when the Caliph went upstairs\\nwith the plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the palace\\nand bring back four slaves bearing a change of raiment, who should\\nwait outside the pavilion till the Caliph should clap his hands', 'Still personating the fisherman, the Caliph answered: \\n\"Scheih Ibrahim, whatever is in the purse I will share equally\\nwith you, but as to the slave I will keep her for myself', 'If you do not agree to these conditions you shall have nothing', '\"\\n\\nThe old man, furious at this insolence as he considered it,\\ntook a cup and threw it at the Caliph, who easily avoided a missile\\nfrom the hand of a drunken man', 'It hit against the wall, and broke\\ninto a thousand pieces', 'Scheih Ibrahim, still more enraged,\\nthen went out to fetch a stick', \"The Caliph at that moment clapped\\nhis hands, and the vizir and the four slaves entering took off\\nthe fisherman's dress and put on him that which they had brought\", 'When Scheih Ibrahim returned, a thick stick in his hand, the Caliph\\nwas seated on his throne, and nothing remained of the fisherman\\nbut his clothes in the middle of the room', 'Throwing himself on the\\nground at the Caliph\\'s feet, he said:  \"Commander of the Faithful,\\nyour miserable slave has offended you, and craves forgiveness', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph came down from his throne, and said:  \"Rise, I forgive thee', '\" \\nThen turning to the Persian he said:  \"Fair lady, now you know who\\nI am; learn also that I have sent Noureddin to Balsora to be king,\\nand as soon as all necessary preparations are made I will send\\nyou there to be queen', 'Meanwhile I will give you an apartment\\nin my palace, where you will be treated with all honour', '\"\\n\\nAt this the beautiful Persian took courage, and the Caliph was as\\ngood as his word, recommending her to the care of his wife Zobeida', 'Noureddin

high above his head he forced his way through the crowd', 'While the king read the letter he changed colour', \"He would instantly\\nhave executed the Caliph's order, but first he showed the letter\\nto Saouy, whose interests were equally at stake with his own\", 'Pretending that he wished to read it a second time, Saouy turned\\naside as if to seek a better light; unperceived by anyone he tore\\noff the formula from the top of the letter, put it to his mouth,\\nand swallowed it', 'Then, turning to the king, he said:\\n\\n\"Your majesty has no need to obey this letter', 'The writing is indeed\\nthat of the Caliph, but the formula is absent', 'Besides, he has not\\nsent an express with the patent, without which the letter is useless', 'Leave all to me, and I will take the consequences', '\"\\n\\nThe king not only listened to the persuasions of Saouy, but gave\\nNoureddin into his hands', 'Such a severe bastinado was first\\nadministered to him, that he was left more

be\\nignorant of it', '\"\\n\\nThe king granted these requests, and the announcement caused\\nuniversal grief, for the memory of Noureddin\\'s father was still fresh\\nin the hearts of his people', 'Saouy, accompanied by twenty of his\\nown slaves, went to the prison to fetch Noureddin, whom he mounted on\\na wretched horse without a saddle', \"Arrived at the palace, Saouy went\\nin to the king,

and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouth\\nof the cave', 'The magician cried out in a great hurry:\\n\\n\"Make haste and give me the lamp', '\"  This Aladdin refused to do until\\nhe was out of the cave', 'The magician flew into a terrible passion,\\nand throwing some more powder on the fire, he said something,\\nand the stone rolled back into its place', \"The magician left Persia for ever,

'Though he alone knew where to find it,\\nhe could only receive it from the hand of another', 'He had picked\\nout the foolish Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lamp\\nand kill him afterwards', 'For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting', 'At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring,\\nwhich the magician had forgotten to take from him', 'Immediately an\\nenormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying:\\n\\n\"What wouldst thou with me', 'I am the Slave of the Ring, and will\\nobey thee in all things', '\"\\n\\nAladdin fearlessly replied:  \"Deliver me from this place', '\"\\nwhereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside', 'As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but fainted\\non the threshold', 'When he came to himself he told his mother\\nwhat had passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he had\\ngathered in the garden, which were in reality precious stones', 'He then asked for some food', '\"Alas', 'child,\" she said, \"I have nothing in the house, but I have\\nspun a little cotton and will go and sell it', '\"\\n\\nAladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead', 'As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch a\\nhigher price', 'Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what she\\nwould have', 'She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp,\\nsaid boldly:\\n\\n\"Fetch me something to eat', '\"\\n\\nThe genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver plates\\ncontaining rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine', 'Aladdin\\'s mother, when she came to her-self, said:\\n\\n\"Whence comes this splendid feast', '\"\\n\\n\"Ask not, but eat,\" replied Aladdin', 'So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdin\\ntold his mother about the lamp', 'She begged him to sell it,\\nand have nothing to do with devils', '\"No,\" said Aladdin, \"since chance has made us aware of its virtues,\\nwe will use it and the ring likewise, which I shall always wear\\non my finger', '\"  When they had eaten all the genie had brought,\\nAladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on till none were left', 'He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates,\\nand thus they lived for many years', 'One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyone\\nwas to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess,\\nhis daughter, went to and from the bath', 'Aladdin was seized by a desire\\nto see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled', 'He hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped through\\na chink', 'The princess lifted her veil as she went in, and looked\\nso beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight', 'He went home so changed that his mother was frightened', 'He told her\\nhe loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her,\\nand meant to ask her in marriage of her father', 'His mother,\\non hearing this, burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailed\\nupon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request', 'She fetched\\na napkin and

week,\\nand stood in the same place', 'When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan said\\nto his vizir:  \"I see a certain woman in the audience-chamber\\nevery day carrying something in a napkin', 'Call her next time,\\nthat I may find out what she wants', '\"\\n\\nNext day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up to the foot of\\nthe throne, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: \\n\"Rise, good woman, and tell me what you want', '\"\\n\\nShe hesitated, so the Sultan sent away all but the vizir, and bade\\nher speak freely, promising to forgive her beforehand for anything

she\\nunfolded the jewels and presented them', 'He was thunderstruck, and turning to the vizir said:  \"What sayest thou', 'Ought I not to bestow the princess on one who values her at such\\na price', '\"\\n\\nThe vizir, who wanted her for his own son, begged the Sultan to withhold\\nher for three months, in the course of which he hoped his son would\\ncontrive to make him a richer present', \"The

months, but after\\ntwo had elapsed his mother, going into the city to buy oil,\\nfound everyone rejoicing, and asked what was going on', '\"Do you not know,\" was the answer, \"that the son of the grand-vizir\\nis to marry the Sultan\\'s daughter to-night', '\"\\n\\nBreathless, she ran and told Aladdin, who was overwhelmed at first,\\nbut presently bethought him of the lamp', 'He rubbed it, and

to speak, the Sultan threatened to cut\\noff her head\", \"She then confessed all, bidding him ask the vizir's\\nson if it were not so\", 'The Sultan told the vizir to ask his son,\\nwho owned the truth, adding that, dearly as he loved the princess,\\nhe had rather die than go through another such fearful night,\\nand wished to be separated from her', 'His wish was granted, and there\\nwas an end of feasting and rejoicing', 'When the three months were over, Aladdin sent his mother to remind\\nthe Sultan of his promise', 'She stood in the same place as before,\\nand the Sultan, who had forgotten Aladdin, at once remembered him,\\nand sent for her', \"On seeing her poverty the Sultan felt less\\ninclined than ever to keep his word, and asked the vizir's advice,\\nwho counselled him

action\\nwhich appears on the face of it to be without any meaning', 'No doubt, in the eyes of men, it has none; but I look on it as a\\nslight expiation for a fearful sin of which I have been guilty,\\nand if your Highness will deign to listen to my tale, you will\\nsee that no punishment could atone for the crime', '\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStory of the Blind Baba-Abdalla\\n\\n\\nI was born, Commander of the Faithful, in Bagdad, and was left\\nan orphan while I was yet a very young man, for my parents died\\nwithin a few days of each other', 'I had inherited from them\\na small fortune, which I worked hard night and day to increase,\\ntill at last I found myself the owner of eighty camels', 'These I\\nhired out to travelling merchants, whom I frequently accompanied\\non their various journeys, and always returned with large profits', 'One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither I had taken a supply\\nof goods, intended for India, and halted at noon in a lonely place,\\nwhich promised rich pasture for my camels', 'I was resting in the\\nshade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora,\\nsat down by my side, and I inquired whence he had come and to what\\nplace he was going', 'We soon made friends, and after we had asked\\neach other the usual questions, we produced the food we had with us,\\nand satisfied our hunger', 'While we were eating, the dervish happened to mention that in a spot\\nonly a little way off from where we were sitting, there was hidden\\na treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till they\\ncould carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full as if it\\nhad never been touched', 'At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed, and I\\nflung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming:  \"Good dervish,\\nI see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to you,\\ntherefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you', 'Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere handful', 'But tell me\\nwhere it is, and I will load my eighty camels with it, and give you\\none of them as a token of my gratitude', '\"\\n\\nCertainly my offer does not sound very magnificent, but it was\\ngreat to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had swept\\nover my heart, and I almost felt as if the seventy-nine camels\\nthat were left were nothing in comparison', 'The dervish saw quite well what was passing in my mind, but he did\\nnot show what he thought of my proposal', '\"My brother,\" he answered quietly, \"you know as well as I do,\\nthat you are behaving unjustly', 'It was open to me to keep my secret,\\nand to reserve the treasure for myself', 'But the fact that I have\\ntold you of its existence shows that I had confidence in you,\\nand that I hoped to earn your gratitude for ever, by making your\\nfortune as well as mine', 'But before I reveal to you the secret\\nof the treasure, you must swear that, after we have loaded the\\ncamels with as much as they can carry, you will give half to me,\\nand let us go our own ways', 'I think you will see that this is fair,\\nfor if you present me with forty camels, I on my side will give you\\nthe means of buying a thousand more', '\"\\n\\nI could not of course deny that what the dervish said was perfectly\\nreasonable, but, in spite of that, the thought that the dervish\\nwould be as rich as I was unbearable to me', 'Still there was no\\nuse in discussing the matter, and I had to accept his conditions\\nor bewail to the end of my life the loss of immense wealth', 'So I collected my camels and we set out together under the guidance\\nof the dervish', 'After walking some time, we reached what looked\\nlike a valley, but with such a narrow entrance that my camels could\\nonly pass one by one', 'The little valley, or open space, was shut\\nup by two mountains, whose sides were formed of straight cliffs,\\nwhich no human being could climb', 'When we were exactly between these mountains the dervish stopped', '\"Make your camels lie down in this open space,\" he said, \"so that we\\ncan easily load them; then we will go to the treasure', '\"\\n\\nI did what I was bid, and rejoined the dervish, whom I found trying\\nto kindle a fire out of some dry wood', 'As soon as it was alight,\\nhe threw on it a handful of perfumes, and pronounced a few words\\nthat I did not understand, and immediately a thick column of smoke\\nrose high into the air', 'He separated the smoke into two columns,\\nand then I saw a rock, which stood like a pillar between the\\ntwo mountains, slowly open, and a splendid palace appear within', 'But, Commander of the Faithful, the love of gold had taken such\\npossession of my heart, that I could not even stop to examine\\nthe riches, but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reach\\nand began to heap it into a sack that I had brought with me', 'The dervish likewise set to work, but I soon noticed that he\\nconfined himself to collecting precious stones, and I felt I\\nshould be wise to follow his example', 'At length the camels\\nwere loaded with as much as they could carry, and nothing\\nremained but to seal up the treasure, and go our ways', 'Before, however, this was done, the dervish went up to a great\\ngolden vase, beautifully chased, and took from it a small wooden box,\\nwhich he hid in the bosom of his dress, merely saying that it\\ncontained a special kind of ointment', 'Then he once more kindled\\nthe fire, threw on the perfume, and murmured the unknown spell,\\nand the rock closed, and stood whole as before', 'The next thing was to divide the camels, and to charge them with\\nthe treasure, after which we each took command of our own and marched\\nout of the valley, till we reached the place in the high road\\nwhere the routes diverge, and then we parted, the dervish going\\ntowards Balsora, and I to Bagdad', 'We embraced each other tenderly,\\nand I poured out my gratitude for the honour he had done me,\\nin singling me out for this great wealth, and having said a hearty\\nfarewell we turned our backs, and hastened after our camels', 'I had hardly come up with mine when the demon of envy filled my soul', '\"What does a dervish want with riches like that', '\"  I said to myself', '\"He alone has the secret of the treasure, and can always get as much\\nas he wants,\" and I halted my camels by the roadside, and ran back\\nafter him', 'I was a quick runner, and it did not take me very long to come up\\nwith him', '\"My brother,\" I exclaimed, as soon as I could speak,\\n\"almost at the moment of our leave-taking, a reflection occurred\\nto me, which is perhaps new to you', 'You are a dervish by profession,\\nand live a very quiet life, only caring to do good, and careless\\nof the things of this world', 'You do not realise the burden that you\\nlay upon yourself, when you gather into your hands such great wealth,\\nbesides the fact that no one, who is not accustomed to camels from\\nhis birth, can ever manage the stubborn beasts', 'If you are wise,\\nyou will not encumber yourself with more than thirty, and you will find\\nthose trouble enough', '\"\\n\\n\"You are right,\" replied the dervish, who understood me quite well,\\nbut did not wish to fight the matter', '\"I confess I had not thought\\nabout it', 'Choose any ten you like, and drive them before you', '\"\\n\\nI selected ten of the best camels, and we proceeded along the road,\\nto rejoin those I had left behind', 'I had got what I wanted, but I\\nhad found the dervish so easy to deal with, that I rather regretted\\nI had not asked for ten more', 'I looked back', 'He had only gone\\na few paces, and I called after him', '\"My brother,\" I said, \"I am unwilling to part from you without\\npointing out what I think you scarcely grasp, that large experience\\nof camel-driving is necessary to anybody who intends to keep\\ntogether a troop of thirty', 'In your own interest, I feel sure you\\nwould be much happier if you entrusted ten more of them to me,\\nfor with my practice it is all one to me if I take two or a hundred', '\"\\n\\nAs before, the dervish made no difficulties, and I drove off my ten\\ncamels in triumph, only leaving him with twenty for his share', 'I had now sixty, and anyone might have imagined that I should\\nbe content', 'But, Commander of the Faithful, there is a proverb that says,\\n\"the more one has, the more one wants', '\"  So it was with me', 'I could not rest as long as one solitary camel remained to the dervish;\\nand returning to him I redoubled my prayers and embraces, and promises\\nof eternal gratitude, till the last twenty were in my hands', '\"Make a good use of them, my brother,\" said the holy man', '\"Remember riches sometimes have wings if we keep them for ourselves,\\nand the poor are at our gates expressly that we may help them', '\"\\n\\nMy eyes were so blinded by gold, that I paid no heed to his wise counsel,\\nand only looked about for something else to grasp', 'Suddenly I\\nremembered the little box of ointment that the dervish had hidden,\\nand which most likely contained a treasure more precious than all\\nthe rest', 'Giving him one last embrace, I observed accidentally,\\n\"What are you going to do with that little box of ointment', 'It seems\\nhardly worth taking with you; you might as well let me have it', 'And really, a dervish who has given up the world has no need\\nof ointment', '\"\\n\\nOh, if he had only refused my request', 'But then, supposing he had,\\nI should have got possession of it by force, so great was the\\nmadness that had laid hold upon me', 'However, far from refusing it,\\nthe dervish at once held it out, saying gracefully, \"Take it,\\nmy friend, and if there is anything else I can do to make you happy\\nyou must let me know', '\"\\n\\nDirectly the box was in my hands I wrenched off the cover', '\"As you are so kind,\" I said, \"tell me, I pray you, what are the\\nvirtues of this ointment', '\"\\n\\n\"They are most curious and interesting,\" replied the dervish', '\"If you apply a little of it to your left eye you will behold\\nin an instant all the treasures hidden in the bowels of the earth', 'But beware lest you touch your right eye with it, or your sight will\\nbe destroyed for ever', '\"\\n\\nHis words excited my curiosity to the highest pitch', '\"Make trial\\non me, I implore you,\" I cried, holding out the box to the dervish', '\"You will know how to do it better than I', 'I am burning with\\nimpatience to test its charms', '\"\\n\\nThe dervish took the box I had extended to him, and, bidding me\\nshut my left eye, touched it gently with the ointment', 'When I\\nopened it again I saw spread out, as it were before me, treasures of\\nevery kind and without number', 'But as all this time I had been\\nobliged to keep my right eye closed, which was very fatiguing,\\nI begged the dervish to apply the ointment to that eye also', '\"If you insist upon it I will do it,\" answered the dervish,\\n\"but you must remember what I told you just now--that if it touches\\nyour right eye you will become blind on the spot', '\"\\n\\nUnluckily, in spite of my having proved the truth of the dervish\\'s words\\nin so many instances, I was firmly convinced that he was now keeping\\nconcealed from me some hidden and precious virtue of the ointment', 'So I turned a deaf ear to all he said', '\"My brother,\" I replied smiling, \"I see you are joking', 'It is\\nnot natural that the same ointment should have two such exactly\\nopposite effects', '\"\\n\\n\"It is true all the same,\" answered the dervish, \"and it would\\nbe well for you if you believed my word', '\"\\n\\nBut I would not believe, and, dazzled by the greed of avarice,\\nI thought that if one eye could show me riches, the other might\\nteach me how to get possession of them', 'And I continued to press\\nthe dervish to anoint my right eye, but this he resolutely declined\\nto do', '\"After having conferred such benefits on you,\" said he, \"I am\\nloth indeed to work you such evil', 'Think what it is to be blind,\\nand do not force me to do what you will repent as long as you live', '\"\\n\\nIt was of no use', '\"My brother,\" I said firmly, \"pray say no more,\\nbut do what I ask', 'You have most generously responded to my wishes\\nup to this time, da not spoil my recollection of you for a thing\\nof such little consequence', 'Let what will happen I take it on my\\nown head, and will never reproach you', '\"\\n\\n\"Since you are determined upon it,\" he answered with a sigh,\\n\"there is no use talking,\" and taking the ointment he laid some\\non my right eye, which was tight shut', 'When I tried to open it\\nheavy clouds of darkness floated before me', 'I was as blind as you\\nsee me now', '\"Miserable dervish', '\"  I shrieked, \"so it is true after all', 'Into what a bottomless pit has my lust after gold plunged me', 'Ah, now that my eyes are closed they are really opened', 'I know that\\nall my sufferings are caused by myself alone', 'But, good brother,\\nyou, who are so kind and charitable, and know the secrets of such\\nvast learning, have you nothing that will give me back my sight', '\"\\n\\n\"Unhappy man,\" replied the dervish, \"it is not my fault that this has\\nbefallen you, but it is a just chastisement', 'The blindness of your\\nheart has wrought the blindness of your body', 'Yes, I have secrets;\\nthat you have seen in the short time that we have known each other', 'But I have none that will give you back your sight', 'You have proved\\nyourself unworthy of the riches that were given you', 'Now they have\\npassed into my hands, whence they will flow into the hands of others\\nless greedy and ungrateful than you', '\"\\n\\nThe dervish said no more and left me, speechless with shame\\nand confusion, and so wretched that I stood rooted to the spot,\\nwhile he collected the eighty camels and proceeded on his way\\nto Balsora', 'It was in vain that I entreated him not to leave me,\\nbut at least to take me within reach of the first passing caravan', 'He was deaf to my prayers and cries, and I should soon have been dead\\nof hunger and misery if some merchants had not come along the track\\nthe following day and kindly brought me back to Bagdad', 'From a rich man I had in one moment become a beggar; and up to this\\ntime I have lived solely on the alms that have been bestowed on me', 'But, in order to expiate the sin of avarice, which was my undoing,\\nI oblige each passer-by to give me a blow', 'This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story', 'When the blind man had ended the Caliph addressed him: \\n\"Baba-Abdalla, truly your sin is great, but you have suffered enough', 'Henceforth repent in private, for I will see that enough money\\nis given you day by day for all your wants', '\"\\n\\nAt these words Baba-Abdalla flung himself at the Caliph\\'s feet,\\nand prayed that honour and happiness might be his portion for ever', 'The Story of Sidi-Nouman\\n\\n\\nThe Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, was much pleased with the tale of\\nthe blind man and the dervish, and when it was finished he turned\\nto the young man who had ill-treated his horse, and inquired\\nhis name also', 'The young man replied that he was called Sidi-Nouman', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" observed the Caliph, \"I have seen horses broken all my\\nlife long, and have even broken them myself, but I have never seen\\nany horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by you yesterday', 'Every one who looked on was indignant, and blamed you loudly', 'As for myself, I was so angry that I was very nearly disclosing\\nwho I was, and putting a stop to it at once', 'Still, you have not\\nthe air of a cruel man, and I would gladly believe that you did not\\nact in this way without some reason', 'As I am told that it was not\\nthe first time, and indeed that every day you are to be seen flogging\\nand spurring your horse, I wish to come to the bottom of the matter', 'But tell me the whole truth, and conceal nothing', '\"\\n\\nSidi-Nouman changed colour as he heard these words, and his manner\\ngrew confused; but he saw plainly that there was no help for it', 'So he prostrated himself before the throne of the Caliph and tried\\nto obey, but the words stuck in his throat, and he remained silent', \"The Caliph, accustomed though he was to instant obedience,\\nguessed something of what was passing in the young man's mind,\\nand sought to put him at his ease\", '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" he said,\\n\"do not think of me as the Caliph, but merely as a friend who would\\nlike to hear your story', 'If there is anything in it that you are\\nafraid may offend me, take courage, for I pardon you beforehand', 'Speak then openly and without fear, as to one who knows and loves you', '\"\\n\\nReassured by the kindness of the Caliph, Sidi-Nouman at length\\nbegan his tale', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" said he, \"dazzled though I am\\nby the lustre of your Highness\\' presence, I will do my best\\nto satisfy your wishes', 'I am by no means perfect, but I am not\\nnaturally cruel, neither do I take pleasure in breaking the law', 'I admit that the treatment of my horse is calculated to give your\\nHighness a bad opinion of me, and to set an evil example to others;\\nyet I have not chastised it without reason, and I have hopes\\nthat I shall be judged more worthy of pity than punishment', '\"\\n\\nCommander of the Faithful, I will not trouble to describe my birth;\\nit is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your Highness\\'\\nattention', 'My ancestors were careful people, and I inherited\\nenough money to enable me to live comfortably, though without show', 'Having therefore a modest fortune, the only thing wanting to my\\nhappiness was a wife who could return my affection, but this blessing\\nI was not destined to get; for on the very day after my marriage,\\nmy bride began to try my patience in every way that was most hard\\nto bear', 'Now, seeing that the customs of our land oblige us to marry without\\never beholding the person with whom we are to pass our lives,\\na man has of course no right to complain as long as his wife\\nis not absolutely repulsive, or is not positively deformed', 'And whatever defects her body may have, pleasant ways and good\\nbehaviour will go far to remedy them', 'The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she had been brought\\nto my house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to find\\nthat I had not been deceived in regard to the account that had been\\ngiven me of her beauty', 'I began my married life in high spirits,\\nand the best hopes of happiness', 'The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife did\\nnot appear, I ordered a servant to call her', 'Still she did not come,\\nand I waited impatiently for some time', 'At last she entered the room,\\nand she took our places at the table, and plates of rice were set\\nbefore us', 'I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my surprise\\nto notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew from her\\npocket a little case, from which she selected a long pin, and by\\nthe help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth', '\"Amina,\" I exclaimed in astonishment, \"is that the way you eat rice\\nat home', 'And did you do it because your appetite was so small,\\nor did you wish to count the grains so that you might never eat\\nmore than a certain number', 'If it was from economy, and you are\\nanxious to teach me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for alarm', 'We shall never ruin ourselves in that way', 'Our fortune is large\\nenough for all our needs, therefore, dear Amina, do not seek to\\ncheck yourself, but eat as much as you desire, as I do', '\"\\n\\nIn reply to my affectionate words, I expected a cheerful answer;\\nyet Amina said nothing at all, but continued to pick her rice\\nas before, only at longer and longer intervals', 'And, instead of\\ntrying the other dishes, all she did was to put every now and then\\na crumb, of bread into her mouth, that would not have made a meal\\nfor a sparrow', 'I felt provoked by her obstinacy, but to excuse her to myself\\nas far as I could, I suggested that perhaps she had never been\\nused to eat in the company of men, and that her family might have\\ntaught her that she ought to behave prudently and discreetly\\nin the presence of her husband', 'Likewise that she might either\\nhave dined already or intend to do so in her own apartments', 'So I took no further notice, and when I had finished left the room,\\nsecretly much vexed at her strange conduct', 'The same thing occurred at supper, and all through the next day,\\nwhenever we ate together', 'It was quite clear that no woman could\\nlive upon two or three bread-crumbs and a few grains of rice,\\nand I determined to find out how and when she got food', 'I pretended\\nnot to pay attention to anything she did, in the hope that little\\nby little she would get accustomed to me, and become more friendly;\\nbut I soon saw that my expectations were quite vain', 'One night I was lying with my eyes closed, and to, all appearance\\nsound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself without\\nmaking the slightest sound', 'I could not imagine what she was going\\nto do, and as my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her', 'When she was fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room', 'The instant she had let the curtain fall behind her, I flung\\na garment on my shoulders and a pair of slippers on my feet', 'Looking from a lattice which opened into the court, I saw her in\\nthe act of passing through the street door, which she carefully\\nleft open', 'It was bright moonlight, so I easily managed to keep her in sight,\\ntill she entered a cemetery not far from the house', 'There I hid\\nmyself under the shadow of the wall, and crouched down cautiously;\\nand hardly was I concealed, when I saw my wife approaching in company\\nwith a ghoul--one of those demons which, as your Highness is aware,\\nwander about the country making their lairs in deserted buildings\\nand springing out upon unwary travellers whose flesh they eat', 'If no live being goes their way, they then betake themselves to\\nthe cemeteries, and feed upon the dead bodies', 'I was nearly struck dumb with horror on seeing my wife with this\\nhideous female ghoul', 'They passed by me without noticing me,\\nbegan to dig up a corpse which had been buried that day, and then\\nsat down on the edge of the grave, to enjoy their frightful repast,\\ntalking quietly and cheerfully all the while, though I was too far\\noff to hear what they said', 'When they had finished, they threw\\nback the body into the grave, and heaped back the earth upon it', 'I made no effort to disturb them, and returned quickly to the house,\\nwhen I took care to leave the door open, as I had previously found it', 'Then I got back into bed, and pretended to sleep soundly', 'A short time after Amina entered as quietly as she had gone out', 'She undressed and stole into bed, congratulating herself apparently\\non the cleverness with which she had managed her expedition', 'As may be guessed, after such a scene it was long before I could\\nclose my eyes, and at the first sound which called the faithful\\nto prayer, I put on my clothes and went to the mosque', 'But even\\nprayer did not restore peace to my troubled spirit, and I could\\nnot face my wife until I had made up my mind what future course\\nI should pursue in regard to her', 'I therefore spent the morning\\nroaming about from one garden to another, turning over various\\nplans for compelling my wife to give up her horrible ways;\\nI thought of using violence to make her submit, but felt reluctant\\nto be unkind to her', 'Besides, I had an instinct that gentle\\nmeans had the best chance of success; so, a little soothed,\\nI turned towards home, which I reached about the hour of dinner', 'As soon as I appeared, Amina ordered dinner to be served, and we\\nsat down together', 'As usual, she persisted in only picking a few\\ngrains of rice, and I resolved to speak to her at once of what lay\\nso heavily on my heart', '\"Amina,\" I said, as quietly as possible, \"you must have guessed\\nthe surprise I felt, when the day after our marriage you declined\\nto eat anything but a few morsels of rice, and altogether behaved\\nin such a manner that most husbands would have been deeply wounded', 'However I had patience with you, and only tried to tempt your appetite\\nby the choicest dishes I could invent, but all to no purpose', 'Still, Amina, it seems to me that there be some among them as sweet\\nto the taste as the flesh of a corpse', '\"\\n\\nI had no sooner uttered these words than Amina, who instantly\\nunderstood that I had followed her to the grave-yard, was seized\\nwith a passion beyond any that I have ever witnessed', 'Her face\\nbecame purple, her eyes looked as if they would start from her head,\\nand she positively foamed with rage', 'I watched her with terror, wondering what would happen next,\\nbut little thinking what would be the end of her fury', 'She seized\\na vessel of water that stood at hand, and plunging her hand in it,\\nmurmured some words I failed to catch', 'Then, sprinkling it on my face,\\nshe cried madly:\\n\\n\"Wretch, receive the reward of your prying, and become a dog', '\"\\n\\nThe words were not out of her mouth when, without feeling conscious\\nthat any change was passing over me, I suddenly knew that I had ceased\\nto be a man', 'In the greatness of the shock and surprise--for I had\\nno idea that Amina was a magician--I never dreamed of running away,\\nand stood rooted to the spot, while Amina grasped a stick and began\\nto beat me', 'Indeed her blows were so heavy, that I only wonder they\\ndid not kill me at once', 'However they succeeded in rousing me from\\nmy stupor, and I dashed into the court-yard, followed closely by Amina,\\nwho made frantic dives at me, which I was not quick enough to dodge', 'At last she got tired of pursuing me, or else a new trick entered\\ninto her head, which would give me speedy and painful death;\\nshe opened the gate leading into the street, intending to crush me\\nas I passed through', 'Dog though I was, I saw through her design,\\nand stung into presence of mind by the greatness of the danger,\\nI timed my movements so well that I contrived to rush through,\\nand only the tip of my tail received a squeeze as she banged\\nthe gate', 'I was safe, but my tail hurt me horribly, and I yelped and howled so\\nloud all along the streets, that the other dogs came and attacked me,\\nwhich made matters no better', \"In order to avoid them, I took\\nrefuge in a cookshop, where tongues and sheep's heads were sold\", 'At first the owner showed me great kindness, and drove away\\nthe other dogs that were still at my heels, while I crept into\\nthe darkest corner', 'But though I was safe for the moment,\\nI was not destined to remain long under his protection, for he\\nwas one of those who hold all dogs to be unclean, and that all the\\nwashing in the world will hardly purify you from their contact', 'So after my enemies had gone to seek other prey, he tried to\\nlure me from my corner in order to force me into the street', 'But I refused to come out of my hole, and spent the night in sleep,\\nwhich I sorely needed, after the pain inflicted on me by Amina', \"I have no wish to weary your Highness by dwelling on the sad thoughts\\nwhich accompanied my change of shape, but it may interest you to hear\\nthat the next morning my host went out early to do his marketing,\\nand returned laden with the sheep's heads, and tongues and trotters\\nthat formed his stock in trade for the day\", 'The smell of meat\\nattracted various hungry dogs in the neighbourhood, and they gathered\\nround the door begging for some bits', 'I stole out of my corner,\\nand stood with them', 'In spite of his objection to dogs, as unclean animals, my protector\\nwas a kind-hearted man, and knowing I had eaten nothing since yesterday,\\nhe threw me bigger and better bits than those which fell to the\\nshare of the other dogs', 'When I had finished, I tried to go back\\ninto the shop, but this he would not allow, and stood so firmly at\\nthe entrance with a stout stick, that I was forced to give it up,\\nand seek some other home', \"A few paces further on was a baker's shop, which seemed to have\\na gay and merry man for a master\", 'At that moment he was having\\nhis breakfast, and though I gave no signs of hunger, he at once\\nthrew me a piece of bread', 'Before gobbling it up, as most dogs\\nare in the habit of doing, I bowed my head and wagged my tail,\\nin token of thanks, and he understood, and smiled pleasantly', 'I really did not want the bread at all, but felt it would be\\nungracious to refuse, so I ate it slowly, in order that he might see\\nthat I only did it out of politeness', 'He understood this also,\\nand seemed quite willing to let me stay in his shop, so I sat down,\\nwith my face to the door, to show that I only asked his protection', \"This he gave me, and indeed encouraged me to come into the\\nhouse itself, giving me a corner where I might sleep, without being\\nin anybody's way\", 'The kindness heaped on me by this excellent man was far greater\\nthan I could ever have expected', 'He was always affectionate\\nin his manner of treating me, and I shared his breakfast,\\ndinner and supper, while, on my side, I gave him all the gratitude\\nand attachment to which he had a right', 'I sat with my eyes fixed on him, and he never left the house\\nwithout having me at his heels; and if it ever happened that when\\nhe was preparing to go out I was asleep, and did not notice,\\nhe would call \"Rufus, Rufus,\" for that was the name he gave me', 'Some weeks passed in this way, when one day a woman came in to buy bread', 'In paying for it, she laid down several pieces of money, one of\\nwhich was bad', 'The baker perceived this, and declined to take it,\\ndemanding another in its place', 'The woman, for her part, refused to\\ntake it back, declaring it was perfectly good, but the baker would\\nhave nothing to do with it', '\"It is really such a bad imitation,\"\\nhe exclaimed at last, \"that even my dog would not be taken in', 'Here Rufus', 'Rufus', '\" and hearing his voice, I jumped on to the counter', 'The baker threw down the money before me, and said, \"Find out\\nif there is a bad coin', '\"  I looked at each in turn, and then laid\\nmy paw on the false one, glancing at the same time at my master,\\nso as to point it out', 'The baker, who had of course been only in joke, was exceedingly\\nsurprised at my cleverness, and the woman, who was at last convinced\\nthat the man spoke the truth, produced another piece of money\\nin its place', 'When she had gone, my master was so pleased that he\\ntold all the neighbours what I had done, and made a great deal\\nmore of it than there really was', 'The neighbours, very naturally, declined to believe his story,\\nand tried me several times with all the bad money they could\\ncollect together, but I never failed to stand the test triumphantly', 'Soon, the shop was filled from morning till night, with people\\nwho on the pretence of buying bread came to see if I was as clever\\nas I was reported to be', 'The baker drove a roaring trade,\\nand admitted that I was worth my weight in gold to him', 'Of course there were plenty who envied him his large custom,\\nand many was the pitfall set for me, so that he never dared to let\\nme out of his sight', 'One day a woman, who had not been in the\\nshop before, came to ask for bread, like the rest', 'As usual,\\nI was lying on the counter, and she threw down six coins before me,\\none of which was false', 'I detected it at once, and put my paw on it,\\nlooking as I did so at the woman', '\"Yes,\" she said, nodding her head', '\"You are quite right, that is the one', '\"  She stood gazing at me\\nattentively for some time, then paid for the bread, and left the shop,\\nmaking a sign for me to follow her secretly', 'Now my thoughts were always running on some means of shaking off\\nthe spell laid on me, and noticing the way in which this woman\\nhad looked at me, the idea entered my head that perhaps she might\\nhave guessed what had happened, and in this I was not deceived', 'However I let her go on a little way, and merely stood at the door\\nwatching her', 'She turned, and seeing that I was quite still,\\nshe again beckoned to me', 'The baker all this while was busy with his oven, and had forgotten\\nall about me, so I stole out softly, and ran after the woman', 'When we came to her house, which was some distance off, she opened\\nthe door and then said to me, \"Come in, come in; you will never be\\nsorry that you followed me', '\"  When I had entered she fastened the door,\\nand took me into a large room, where a beautiful girl was working\\nat a piece of embroidery', '\"My daughter,\" exclaimed my guide,\\n\"I have brought you the famous dog belonging to the baker which can\\ntell good money from bad', 'You know that when I first heard of him,\\nI told you I was sure he must be really a man, changed into a dog\\nby magic', \"To-day I went to the baker's, to prove for myself\\nthe truth of the story, and persuaded the dog to follow me here\", 'Now what do you say', '\"\\n\\n\"You are right, mother,\" replied the girl, and rising she dipped her\\nhand into a vessel of water', 'Then sprinkling it over me she said,\\n\"If you were born dog, remain dog; but if you were born man,\\nby virtue of this water resume your proper form', '\"  In one moment the\\nspell was broken', \"The dog's shape vanished as if it had never been,\\nand it was a man who stood before her\", 'Overcome with gratitude at my deliverance, I flung myself at\\nher feet, and kissed the hem of her garment', '\"How can I thank you\\nfor your goodness towards a stranger, and for what you have done', 'Henceforth I am your slave', 'Deal with me as you will', '\"\\n\\nThen, in order to explain how I came to be changed into a dog,\\nI told her my whole story, and finished with rendering the mother\\nthe thanks due to her for the happiness she had brought me', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" returned the daughter, \"say no more about the\\nobligation you are under to us', 'The knowledge that we have been\\nof service to you is ample payment', 'Let us speak of Amina, your wife,\\nwith whom I was acquainted before her marriage', 'I was aware that she\\nwas a magician, and she knew too that I had studied the same art,\\nunder the same mistress', 'We met often going to the same baths,\\nbut we did not like each other, and never sought to become friends', 'As to what concerns you, it is not enough to have broken your spell,\\nshe must be punished for her wickedness', 'Remain for a moment with\\nmy mother, I beg,\" she added hastily, \"I will return shortly', '\"\\n\\nLeft alone with the mother, I again expressed the gratitude I felt,\\nto her as well as to her daughter', '\"My daughter,\" she answered, \"is, as you see, as accomplished a magician\\nas Amina herself, but you would be astonished at the amount of good\\nshe does by her knowledge', 'That is why I have never interfered,\\notherwise I should have put a stop to it long ago', '\"  As she spoke,\\nher daughter entered with a small bottle in her hand', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" she said, \"the books I have just consulted tell\\nme that Amina is not home at present, but she should return at\\nany moment', 'I have likewise found out by their means, that she\\npretends before the servants great uneasiness as to your absence', 'She has circulated a story that, while at dinner with her,\\nyou remembered some important business that had to be done at once,\\nand left the house without shutting the door', 'By this means a dog\\nhad strayed in, which she was forced to get rid of by a stick', \"Go home then without delay, and await Amina's return in your room\", 'When she comes in, go down to meet her, and in her surprise, she will\\ntry to run away', 'Then have this bottle ready, and dash the water it\\ncontains over her, saying boldly, \"Receive the reward of your crimes', '\" \\nThat is all I have to tell you', '\"\\n\\nEverything happened exactly as the young magician had foretold', 'I had not been in my house many minutes before Amina returned, and as\\nshe approached I stepped in front of her, with the water in my hand', 'She gave one loud cry, and turned to the door, but she was too late', 'I had already dashed the water in her face and spoken the magic words', 'Amina disappeared, and in her place stood the horse you saw me\\nbeating yesterday', 'This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story, and may I venture\\nto hope that, now you have heard the reason of my conduct,\\nyour Highness will not think this wicked woman too harshly treated', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" replied the Caliph, \"your story is indeed a strange one,\\nand there is no excuse to be offered for your wife', 'But, without\\ncondemning your treatment of her, I wish you to reflect how much\\nshe must suffer from being changed into an animal, and I hope you\\nwill let that punishment be enough', 'I do not order you to insist\\nupon the young magician finding the means to restore your wife to her\\nhuman shape, because I know that when once women such as she begin\\nto work evil they never leave off, and I should only bring down on\\nyour head a vengeance far worse than the one you have undergone already', '\"\\n\\n\\n\\nStory of Ali Colia, Merchant of Bagdad\\n\\n\\nIn the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived in Bagdad a\\nmerchant named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child,\\ncontented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade', 'He had spent some years quite happily in the house his father had\\nleft him, when three nights running he dreamed that an old man had\\nappeared to him, and reproached him for having neglected the duty\\nof a good Mussulman, in delaying so long his pilgrimage to Mecca', 'Ali Cogia was much troubled by this dream, as he was unwilling\\nto give up his shop, and lose all his customers', 'He had shut his\\neyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage,\\nand tried to atone to his conscience by an extra number of good works,\\nbut the dream seemed to him a direct warning, and he resolved to put\\nthe journey off no longer', 'The first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wares\\nhe had in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as he\\nmight trade with on the road', 'The shop it-self he sold also,\\nand easily found a tenant for his private house', 'The only matter he\\ncould not settle satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousand\\npieces of gold which he wished to leave behind him', 'After some thought, Ali Cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a safe one', 'He took a large vase, and placing the money in the bottom of it,\\nfilled up the rest with olives', 'After corking the vase tightly down,\\nhe carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like himself,\\nand said to him:\\n\\n\"My brother, you have probably heard that I am staffing with a caravan\\nin a few days for Mecca', 'I have come to ask whether you would\\ndo me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I come back', '\"\\n\\nThe merchant replied readily, \"Look, this is the key of my shop: \\ntake it, and put the vase wherever you like', 'I promise that you shall\\nfind it in the same place on your return', '\"\\n\\nA few days later, Ali Cogia mounted the camel that he had laden\\nwith merchandise, joined the caravan, and arrived in due time\\nat Mecca', 'Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque,\\nand after all his religious duties were performed, he set out his\\ngoods to the best advantage, hoping to gain some customers among\\nthe passers-by', 'Very soon two merchants stopped before the pile, and when they\\nhad turned it over, one said to the other:\\n\\n\"If this man was wise he would take these things to Cairo, where he\\nwould get a much better price than he is likely to do here', '\"\\n\\nAli Cogia heard the words, and lost no time in following the advice', 'He packed up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad,\\njoined a caravan that was going to Cairo', 'The results of the journey\\ngladdened his heart', 'He sold off everything almost directly,\\nand bought a stock of Egyptian curiosities, which he intended selling\\nat Damascus; but as the caravan with which he would have to travel\\nwould not be starting for another six weeks, he took advantage\\nof the delay to visit the Pyramids, and some of the cities along\\nthe banks of the Nile', 'Now the attractions of Damascus so fascinated the worthy Ali,\\nthat he could hardly tear himself away, but at length he remembered\\nthat he had a home in Bagdad, meaning to return by way of Aleppo,\\nand after he had crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course of\\nthe Tigris', 'But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such friends with some\\nPersian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany them\\nto their native land, and even as far as India, and so it came\\nto pass that seven years had slipped by since he had left Bagdad,\\nand during all that time the friend with whom he had left the vase\\nof olives had never once thought of him or of it', \"In fact,\\nit was only a month before Ali Cogia's actual return that the affair\\ncame into his head at all, owing to his wife's remarking one day,\\nthat it was a long time since she had eaten any olives, and would\\nlike some\", '\"That reminds me,\" said the husband, \"that before Ali Cogia went\\nto Mecca seven years ago, he left a vase of olives in my care', 'But really by this time he must be dead, and there is no reason we\\nshould not eat the olives if we like', 'Give me a light, and I will\\nfetch them and see how they taste', '\"\\n\\n\"My husband,\" answered the wife, \"beware, I pray, of your doing\\nanything so base', 'Supposing seven years have passed without news\\nof Ali Cogia, he need not be dead for all that, and may come back\\nany day', 'How shameful it would be to have to confess that you\\nhad betrayed your trust and broken the seal of the vase', 'Pay no\\nattention to my idle words, I really have no desire for olives now', 'And probably after all this while they are no longer good', 'I have a presentiment that Ali Cogia will return, and what will he\\nthink of you', 'Give it up, I entreat', '\"\\n\\nThe merchant, however, refused to listen to her advice, sensible\\nthough it was', 'He took a light and a dish and went into his shop', '\"If you will be so obstinate,\" said his wife, \"I cannot help it;\\nbut do not blame me if it turns out ill', '\"\\n\\nWhen the merchant opened the vase he found the topmost olives\\nwere rotten, and in order to see if the under ones were in better\\ncondition he shook some out into the dish', 'As they fell out a few\\nof the gold pieces fell out too', \"The sight of the money roused all the merchant's greed\", 'He looked\\ninto the vase, and saw that all the bottom was filled with gold', 'He then replaced the olives and returned to his wife', '\"My wife,\" he said, as he entered the room, \"you were quite right;\\nthe olives are rotten, and I have recorked the vase so well that Ali\\nCogia will never know it has been touched', '\"\\n\\n\"You would have done better to believe me,\" replied the wife', '\"I trust that no harm will come of it', '\"\\n\\nThese words made no more impression on the merchant than the others\\nhad done; and he spent the whole night in wondering how he could manage\\nto keep the gold if Ali Cogia should come back and claim his vase', 'Very early next morning he went out and bought fresh new olives;\\nhe then threw away the old ones, took out the gold and hid it,\\nand filled up the vase with the olives he had bought', 'This done he\\nrecorked the vase and put it in the same place where it had been left\\nby Ali Cogia', 'A month later Ali Cogia re-entered Bagdad, and as his house was\\nstill let he went to an inn; and the following day set out to see\\nhis friend the merchant, who received him with open arms and many\\nexpressions of surprise', 'After a few moments given to inquiries\\nAli Cogia begged the merchant to hand him over the vase that he\\nhad taken care of for so long', '\"Oh certainly,\" said he, \"I am only glad I could be of use to you\\nin the matter', 'Here is the key of my shop; you will find the vase\\nin the place where you put it', '\"\\n\\nAli Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the inn,\\nwhere he opened it', 'He thrust down his hand but could feel no money,\\nbut still was persuaded it must be there', 'So he got some plates\\nand vessels from his travelling kit and emptied out the olives', 'To no purpose', 'The gold was not there', 'The poor man was dumb\\nwith horror, then, lifting up his hands, he exclaimed, \"Can my old\\nfriend really have committed such a crime', '\"\\n\\nIn great haste he went back to the house of the merchant', '\"My friend,\"\\nhe cried, \"you will be astonished to see me again, but I can find\\nnowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I placed in the\\nbottom under the olives', 'Perhaps you may have taken a loan of them\\nfor your business purposes; if that is so you are most welcome', 'I will only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay the money\\nat your leisure', '\"\\n\\nThe merchant, who had expected something of the sort, had his reply\\nall ready', '\"Ali Cogia,\" he said, \"when you brought me the vase\\nof olives did I ever touch it', '\"\\n\\n\"I gave you the key of my shop and you put it yourself where you liked,\\nand did you not find it in exactly the same spot and in the\\nsame state', 'If you placed any gold in it, it must be there still', 'I know nothing about that; you only told me there were olives', 'You can believe me or not, but I have not laid a finger on the vase', '\"\\n\\nAli Cogia still tried every means to persuade the merchant to admit\\nthe truth', '\"I love peace,\" he said, \"and shall deeply regret having\\nto resort to harsh measures', 'Once more, think of your reputation', 'I shall be in despair if you oblige me to call in the aid of the law', '\"\\n\\n\"Ali Cogia,\" answered the merchant, \"you allow that it was a vase\\nof olives you placed in my charge', 'You fetched it and removed\\nit yourself, and now you tell me it contained a thousand pieces\\nof gold, and that I must restore them to you', 'Did you ever say\\nanything about them before', 'Why, I did not even know that the\\nvase had olives in it', 'Yon never showed them to me', 'I wonder\\nyou have not demanded pearls or diamonds', 'Retire, I pray you,\\nlest a crowd should gather in front of my shop', '\"\\n\\nBy this time not only the casual passers-by, but also the\\nneighbouring merchants, were standing round, listening to the dispute,\\nand trying every now and then to smooth matters between them', \"But at the merchant's last words Ali Cogia resolved to lay the\\ncause of the quarrel before them, and told them the whole story\", 'They heard him to the end, and inquired of the merchant what he\\nhad to say', \"The accused man admitted that he had kept Ali Cogia's vase in his shop;\\nbut he denied having touched it, and swore that as to what it\\ncontained he only knew what Ali Cogia had told him, and called\\nthem all to witness the insult that had been put upon him\", '\"You have brought it on yourself,\" said Ali Cogia, taking him\\nby the arm, \"and as you appeal to the law, the law you shall have', 'Let us see if you will dare to repeat your story before the Cadi', '\"\\n\\nNow as a good Mussulman the merchant was forbidden to refuse this\\nchoice of a judge, so he accepted the test, and said to Ali Cogia,\\n\"Very well; I should like nothing better', 'We shall soon see which\\nof us is in the right', '\"\\n\\nSo the two men presented themselves before the Cadi, and Ali Cogia\\nagain repeated his tale', 'The Cadi asked what witnesses he had', 'Ali Cogia replied that he had not taken this precaution, as he had\\nconsidered the man his friend, and up to that time had always found\\nhim honest', 'The merchant, on his side, stuck to his story, and offered to swear\\nsolemnly that not only had he never stolen the thousand gold pieces,\\nbut that he did not even know they were there', 'The Cadi allowed him\\nto take the oath, and pronounced him innocent', 'Ali Cogia, furious at having to suffer such a loss, protested against\\nthe verdict, declaring that he would appeal to the Caliph,\\nHaroun-al-Raschid, himself', 'But the Cadi paid no attention\\nto his threats, and was quite satisfied that he had done what was right', 'Judgment being given the merchant returned home triumphant, and Ali\\nCogia went back to his inn to draw up a petition to the Caliph', 'The next morning he placed himself on the road along which the Caliph\\nmust pass after mid-day prayer, and stretched out his petition to the\\nofficer who walked before the Caliph, whose duty it was to collect\\nsuch things, and on entering the palace to hand them to his master', 'There Haroun-al-Raschid studied them carefully', 'Knowing this custom, Ali Cogia followed the Caliph into the public\\nhall of the palace, and waited the result', 'After some time the\\nofficer appeared, and told him that the Caliph had read his petition,\\nand had appointed an hour the next morning to give him audience', \"He then inquired the merchant's address, so that he might be summoned\\nto attend also\", 'That very evening, the Caliph, with his grand-vizir Giafar, and Mesrour,\\nchief of the eunuchs, all three disguised, as was their habit,\\nwent out to take a stroll through the town', \"Going down one street, the Caliph's attention was attracted\\nby a noise, and looking through a door which opened into a court\\nhe perceived ten or twelve children playing in the moonlight\", 'He hid himself in a dark corner, and watched them', '\"Let us play at being the Cadi,\" said the brightest and quickest\\nof them all; \"I will be the Cadi', 'Bring before me Ali Cogia,\\nand the merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold', '\"\\n\\nThe boy\\'s words recalled to the Caliph the petition he had read\\nthat morning, and he waited with interest to see what the children\\nwould do', 'The proposal was hailed with joy by the other children, who had heard\\na great deal of talk about the matter, and they quickly settled\\nthe part each one was to play', 'The Cadi took his seat gravely,\\nand an officer introduced first Ali Cogia, the plaintiff, and then\\nthe merchant who was the defendant', 'Ali Cogia made a low bow, and pleaded his cause point by point;\\nconcluding by imploring the Cadi not to inflict on him such a\\nheavy loss', 'The Cadi having heard his case, turned to the merchant, and inquired\\nwhy he had not repaid Ali Cogia the sum in question', 'The false merchant repeated the reasons that the real merchant\\nhad given to the Cadi of Bagdad, and also offered to swear that he\\nhad told the truth', '\"Stop a moment', '\" said the little Cadi, \"before we come to oaths,\\nI should like to examine the vase with the olives', 'Ali Cogia,\"\\nhe added, \"have you got the vase with you', '\" and finding he had not,\\nthe Cadi continued, \"Go and get it, and bring it to me', '\"\\n\\nSo Ali Cogia disappeared for an instant, and then pretended\\nto lay a vase at the feet of the Cadi, declaring it was his vase,\\nwhich he had given to the accused for safe custody; and in order\\nto be quite correct, the Cadi asked the merchant if he recognised it\\nas the same vase', 'By his silence the merchant admitted the fact,\\nand the Cadi then commanded to have the vase opened', 'Ali Cogia\\nmade a movement as if he was taking off the lid, and the little\\nCadi on his part made a pretence of peering into a vase', '\"What beautiful olives', '\" he said, \"I should like to taste one,\"\\nand pretending to put one in his mouth, he added, \"they are\\nreally excellent', '\"\\n\\n\"But,\" he went on, \"it seems to me odd that olives seven years\\nold should be as good as that', 'Send for some dealers in olives,\\nand let us hear what they say', '\"\\n\\nTwo children were presented to him as olive merchants, and the Cadi\\naddressed them', '\"Tell me,\" he said, \"how long can olives be kept\\nso as to be pleasant eating', '\"\\n\\n\"My lord,\" replied the merchants, \"however much care is taken\\nto preserve them, they never last beyond the third year', 'They lose\\nboth taste and colour, and are only fit to be thrown away', '\"\\n\\n\"If that is so,\" answered the little Cadi, \"examine this vase,\\nand tell me how long the olives have been in it', '\"\\n\\nThe olive merchants pretended to examine the olives and taste them;\\nthen reported to the Cadi that they were fresh and good', '\"You are mistaken,\" said he, \"Ali Cogia declares he put them\\nin that vase seven years ago', '\"\\n\\n\"My lord,\" returned the olive merchants, \"we can assure you that\\nthe olives are those of the present year', 'And if you consult all\\nthe merchants in Bagdad you will not find one to give a contrary opinion', '\"\\n\\nThe accused merchant opened his mouth as if to protest, but the\\nCadi gave him no time', '\"Be silent,\" he said, \"you are a thief', 'Take him away and hang him', '\"  So the game ended, the children\\nclapping their hands in applause, and leading the criminal away\\nto be hanged', 'Haroun-al-Raschid was lost in astonishment at the wisdom of the child,\\nwho had given so wise a verdict on the case which he himself was\\nto hear on the morrow', '\"Is there any other verdict possible', '\"\\nhe asked the grand-vizir, who was as much impressed as himself', '\"I can imagine no better judgment', '\"\\n\\n\"If the circumstances are really such as we have heard,\"\\nreplied the grand-vizir, \"it seems to me your Highness could\\nonly follow the example of this boy, in the method of reasoning,\\nand also in your conclusions', '\"\\n\\n\"Then take careful note of this house,\" said the Caliph, \"and bring me\\nthe boy to-morrow, so that the affair may be tried by him in my presence', 'Summon also the Cadi, to learn his duty from the mouth of a child', 'Bid Ali Cogia bring his vase of olives, and see that two dealers\\nin olives are present', '\"  So saying the Caliph returned to the palace', 'The next morning early, the grand-vizir went back to the house\\nwhere they had seen the children playing, and asked for the mistress\\nand her children', 'Three boys appeared, and the grand-vizir inquired\\nwhich had represented the Cadi in their game of the previous evening', \"The eldest and tallest, changing colour, confessed that it was he,\\nand to his mother's great alarm, the grand-vizir said that he had\\nstrict orders to bring him into the presence of the Caliph\", '\"Does he want to take my son from me', '\" cried the poor woman;\\nbut the grand-vizir hastened to calm her, by assuring her that she\\nshould have the boy again in an hour, and she would be quite\\nsatisfied when she knew the reason of the summons', 'So she dressed\\nthe boy in his best clothes, and the two left the house', 'When the grand-vizir presented the child to the Caliph, he was\\na little awed and confused, and the Caliph proceeded to explain\\nwhy he had sent for him', '\"Approach, my son,\" he said kindly', '\"I think it was you who judged the case of Ali Cogia and the merchant\\nlast night', 'I overheard you by chance, and was very pleased\\nwith the way you conducted it', 'To-day you will see the real Ali\\nCogia and the real merchant', 'Seat yourself at once next to me', '\"\\n\\nThe Caliph being seated on his throne with the boy next him, the parties\\nto the suit were ushered in', 'One by one they prostrated themselves,\\nand touched the carpet at the foot of the throne with their foreheads', 'When they rose up, the Caliph said:  \"Now speak', 'This child will\\ngive you justice, and if more should be wanted I will see to it myself', '\"\\n\\nAli Cogia and the merchant pleaded one after the other,\\nbut when the merchant offered to swear the same oath that he\\nhad taken before the Cadi, he was stopped by the child, who said\\nthat before this was done he must first see the vase of olives', 'At these words, Ali Cogia presented the vase to the Caliph,\\nand uncovered it', 'The Caliph took one of the olives, tasted it,\\nand ordered the expert merchants to do the same', 'They pronounced\\nthe olives good, and fresh that year', 'The boy informed them that Ali\\nCogia declared it was seven years since he had placed them in the vase;\\nto which they returned the same answer as the children had done', 'The accused merchant saw by this time that his condemnation\\nwas certain, and tried to allege something in his defence', 'The boy had too much sense to order him to be hanged, and looked at\\nthe Caliph, saying, \"Commander of the Faithful, this is not a game now;\\nit is for your Highness to condemn him to death and not for me', '\"\\n\\nThen the Caliph, convinced that the man was a thief, bade them take\\nhim away and hang him, which was done, but not before he had confessed\\nhis guilt and the place in which he had hidden Ali Cogia\\'s money', 'The Caliph ordered the Cadi to learn how to deal out justice from\\nthe mouth of a child, and sent the boy home, with a purse containing\\na hundred pieces of gold as a mark of his favour', 'The Enchanted Horse\\n\\n\\nIt was the Feast of the New Year, the oldest and most splendid of\\nall the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia, and the day had been spent\\nby the king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the magnificent\\nspectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival', 'The sun was setting, and the monarch was about to give his court the\\nsignal to retire, when suddenly an Indian appeared before his throne,\\nleading a horse richly harnessed, and looking in every respect\\nexactly like a real one', '\"Sire,\" said he, prostrating himself as he spoke, \"although I make\\nmy appearance so late before your Highness, I can confidently\\nassure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the day\\ncan be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyes\\nupon him', '\"\\n\\n\"I see nothing in it,\" replied the king, \"except a clever imitation\\nof a real one; and any skilled workman might do as much', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" returned the Indian, \"it is not of his outward form that I\\nwould speak, but of the use that I can make of him', 'I have only\\nto mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and no\\nmatter how distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall find\\nmyself there', 'It is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous,\\nand if your Highness will allow me, you can prove it for yourself', '\"\\n\\nThe King of Persia, who was interested in every thing out of the common,\\nand had never before come across a horse with such qualities,\\nbade the Indian mount tho animal, and show what he could do', 'In an instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired where\\nthe monarch wished to send him', '\"Do you see that mountain', '\" asked the king, pointing to a huge\\nmass that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz;\\n\"go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot', '\"\\n\\nThe words were hardly out of the king\\'s mouth when the Indian\\nturned a screw placed in the horse\\'s neck, close to the saddle,\\nand the animal bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soon\\nbeyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes', 'In a quarter of an\\nhour the Indian was seen returning, bearing in his hand the palm,\\nand, guiding his horse to the foot of the throne, he dismounted,\\nand laid the leaf before the king', 'Now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which the\\nhorse was capable than he longed to possess it himself, and indeed,\\nso sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to sell it,\\nthat he looked upon it as his own already', '\"I never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he was,\"\\nhe remarked to the Indian, \"and I am grateful to you for having shown\\nme my error,\" said he', '\"If you will sell it, name your own price', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the Indian, \"I never doubted that a sovereign so wise\\nand accomplished as your Highness would do justice to my horse,\\nwhen he once knew its power; and I even went so far as to think it\\nprobable that you might wish to possess it', 'Greatly as I prize it,\\nI will yield it up to your Highness on one condition', 'The horse\\nwas not constructed by me, but it was given me by the inventor,\\nin exchange for my only daughter, who made me take a solemn oath that I\\nwould never part with it, except for some object of equal value', '\"\\n\\n\"Name anything you like,\" cried the monarch, interrupting him', '\"My kingdom is large, and filled with fair cities', 'You have only\\nto choose which you would prefer, to become its ruler to the end\\nof your life', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" answered the Indian, to whom the proposal did not seem\\nnearly so generous as it appeared to the king, \"I am most\\ngrateful to your Highness for your princely offer, and beseech\\nyou not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliver\\nup my horse in exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter', '\"\\n\\nA shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words,\\nand Prince Firouz Schah, the heir apparent, was filled with anger\\nat the Indian\\'s presumption', 'The king, however, thought that it\\nwould not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gain\\nsuch a delightful toy, and while he was hesitating as to his answer\\nthe prince broke in', '\"Sire,\" he said, \"it is not possible that you can doubt for an\\ninstant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain', 'Consider what you owe to yourself, and to the blood of your ancestors', '\"\\n\\n\"My son,\" replied the king, \"you speak nobly, but you do not\\nrealise either the value of the horse, or the fact that if I reject\\nthe proposal of the Indian, he will only make the same to some\\nother monarch, and I should be filled with despair at the thought\\nthat anyone but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World', \"Of course I do not say that I shall accept his conditions,\\nand perhaps he may be brought to reason, but meanwhile I should\\nlike you to examine the horse, and, with the owner's permission,\\nto make trial of its powers\", '\"\\n\\nThe Indian, who had overheard the king\\'s speech, thought that he\\nsaw in it signs of yielding to his proposal, so he joyfully agreed\\nto the monarch\\'s wishes, and came forward to help the prince to mount\\nthe horse, and show him how to guide it:  but, before he had finished,\\nthe young man turned the screw, and was soon out of sight', 'They waited some time, expecting that every moment he might be seen\\nreturning in the distance, but at length the Indian grew frightened,\\nand prostrating himself before the throne, he said to the king,\\n\"Sire, your Highness must have noticed that the prince,\\nin his impatience, did not allow me to tell him what it was necessary\\nto do in order to return to the place from which he started', 'I implore you not to punish me for what was not my fault, and not\\nto visit on me any misfortune that may occur', '\"\\n\\n\"But why,\" cried the king in a burst of fear and anger, \"why did\\nyou not call him back when you saw him disappearing', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the Indian, \"the rapidity of his movements took me\\nso by surprise that he was out of hearing before I recovered my speech', 'But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second screw,\\nwhich will have the effect of bringing the horse back to earth', '\"\\n\\n\"But supposing he does', '\" answered the king, \"what is to hinder\\nthe horse from descending straight into the sea, or dashing him\\nto pieces on the rocks', '\"\\n\\n\"Have no fears, your Highness,\" said the Indian; \"the horse has\\nthe gift of passing over seas, and of carrying his rider wherever\\nhe wishes to go', '\"\\n\\n\"Well, your head shall answer for it,\" returned the monarch, \"and if\\nin three months he is not safe back with me, or at any rate does\\nnot send me news of his safety, your life shall pay the penalty', '\" \\nSo saying, he ordered his guards to seize the Indian and throw him\\ninto prison', 'Meanwhile, Prince Firouz Schah had gone gaily up into the air,\\nand for the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and higher,\\ntill the very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains', 'Then he began to think it was time to come down, and took for granted\\nthat, in order to do this, it was only needful to turn the screw\\nthe reverse way; but, to his surprise and horror, he found that,\\nturn as he might, he did not make the smallest impression', 'He then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he was to get\\nback to earth again, and understood the danger in which he stood', \"Luckily, he did not lose his head, and set about examining the\\nhorse's neck with great care, till at last, to his intense joy,\\nhe discovered a tiny little peg, much smaller than the other,\\nclose to the right ear\", 'This he turned, and found him-self dropping\\nto the earth, though more slowly than he had left it', 'It was now dark, and as the prince could see nothing, he was obliged,\\nnot without some feeling of disquiet, to allow the horse to direct\\nhis own course, and midnight was already passed before Prince Firouz\\nSchah again touched the ground, faint and weary from his long ride,\\nand from the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning', 'The first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out where\\nhe was, and, as far as he could discover in the thick darkness,\\nhe found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace, with a\\nbalustrade of marble running round', 'In one corner of the terrace stood\\na small door, opening on to a staircase which led down into the palace', 'Some people might have hesitated before exploring further, but not\\nso the prince', '\"I am doing no harm,\" he said, \"and whoever the owner\\nmay be, he will not touch me when he sees I am unarmed,\" and in dread\\nof making a false step, he went cautiously down the staircase', 'On a landing, he noticed an open door, beyond which was a faintly\\nlighted hall', 'Before entering, the prince paused and listened, but he heard\\nnothing except the sound of men snoring', 'By the light of a lantern\\nsuspended from the roof, he perceived a row of black guards sleeping,\\neach with a naked sword lying by him, and he understood that the hall\\nmust form the ante-room to the chamber of some queen or princess', 'Standing quite still, Prince Firouz Schah looked about him, till his\\neyes grew accustomed to the gloom, and he noticed a bright light\\nshining through a curtain in one corner', 'He then made his way softly\\ntowards it, and, drawing aside its folds, passed into a magnificent\\nchamber full of sleeping women, all lying on low couches, except one,\\nwho was on a sofa; and this one, he knew, must be the princess', 'Gently stealing up to the side of her bed he looked at her, and saw\\nthat she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever beheld', 'But, fascinated though he was, he was well aware of the danger\\nof his position, as one cry of surprise would awake the guards,\\nand cause his certain death', 'So sinking quietly on his knees, he took hold of the sleeve of\\nthe princess and drew her arm lightly towards him', 'The princess\\nopened her eyes, and seeing before her a handsome well-dressed man,\\nshe remained speechless with astonishment', 'This favourable moment was seized by the prince, who bowing low\\nwhile he knelt, thus addressed her:\\n\\n\"You behold, madame, a prince in distress, son to the King of Persia,\\nwho, owing to an adventure so strange that you will scarcely\\nbelieve it, finds himself here, a suppliant for your protection', \"But yesterday, I was in my father's court, engaged in the celebration\\nof our most solemn festival; to-day, I am in an unknown land,\\nin danger of my life\", '\"\\n\\nNow the princess whose mercy Prince Firouz Schah implored was the eldest\\ndaughter of the King of Bengal, who was enjoying rest and change in the\\npalace her father had built her, at a little distance from the capital', 'She listened kindly to what he had to say, and then answered:\\n\\n\"Prince, be not uneasy; hospitality and humanity are practised\\nas widely in Bengal as they are in Persia', 'The protection you ask\\nwill be given you by all', 'You have my word for it', '\"  And as the\\nprince was about to thank her for her goodness, she added quickly,\\n\"However great may be my curiosity to learn by what means you\\nhave travelled here so speedily, I know that you must be faint\\nfor want of food, so I shall give orders to my women to take you\\nto one of my chambers, where you will be provided with supper,\\nand left to repose', '\"\\n\\nBy this time the princess\\'s attendants were all awake, and listening\\nto the conversation', 'At a sign from their mistress they rose,\\ndressed themselves hastily, and snatching up some of the tapers which\\nlighted the room, conducted the prince to a large and lofty room,\\nwhere two of the number prepared his bed, and the rest went down\\nto the kitchen, from which they soon returned with all sorts\\nof dishes', 'Then, showing him cupboards filled with dresses and linen,\\nthey quitted the room', 'During their absence the Princess of Bengal, who had been greatly struck\\nby the beauty of the prince, tried in vain to go to sleep again', 'It was of no use:  she felt broad awake, and when her women entered\\nthe room, she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted,\\nand what they thought of him', '\"Madame,\" they replied, \"it is of course impossible for us to tell\\nwhat impression this young man has made on you', 'For ourselves,\\nwe think you would be fortunate if the king your father should\\nallow you to marry anyone so amiable', 'Certainly there is no one\\nin the Court of Bengal who can be compared with him', '\"\\n\\nThese flattering observations were by no means displeasing to\\nthe princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings she\\nmerely said, \"You are all a set of chatterboxes; go back to bed,\\nand let me sleep', '\"\\n\\nWhen she dressed the following morning, her maids noticed that,\\ncontrary to her usual habit, the princess was very particular about\\nher toilette, and insisted on her hair being dressed two or three\\ntimes over', '\"For,\" she said to herself, \"if my appearance was not\\ndispleasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was,\\nhow much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with all\\nmy charms', '\"\\n\\nThen she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant diamonds\\nshe could find, with a necklace, bracelets and girdle, all of\\nprecious stones', 'And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of the\\nrichest stuff in all the Indies, that no one was allowed to wear except\\nmembers of the royal family', 'When she was fully dressed according\\nto her wishes, she sent to know if the Prince of Persia was awake\\nand ready to receive her, as she desired to present herself before him', \"When the princess's messenger entered his room, Prince Firouz Schah\\nwas in the act of leaving it, to inquire if he might be allowed to pay\\nhis homage to her mistress:  but on hearing the princess's wishes,\\nhe at once gave way\", '\"Her will is my law,\" he said, \"I am only\\nhere to obey her orders', '\"\\n\\nIn a few moments the princess herself appeared, and after the usual\\ncompliments had passed between them, the princess sat down on a sofa,\\nand began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving him\\nan audience in her own apartments', '\"Had I done so,\" she said,\\n\"we might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the eunuchs,\\nwho has the right to enter whenever it pleases him, whereas this\\nis forbidden ground', 'I am all impatience to learn the wonderful\\naccident which has procured the pleasure of your arrival, and that\\nis why I have come to you here, where no one can intrude upon us', 'Begin then, I entreat you, without delay', '\"\\n\\nSo the prince began at the beginning, and told all the story of the\\nfestival of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia, and of the splendid spectacles\\ncelebrated in its honour', 'But when he came to the enchanted horse,\\nthe princess declared that she could never have imagined anything\\nhalf so surprising', '\"Well then,\" continued the prince, \"you can\\neasily understand how the King my father, who has a passion for\\nall curious things, was seized with a violent desire to possess\\nthis horse, and asked the Indian what sum he would take for it', '\"\\n\\n\"The man\\'s answer was absolutely absurd, as you will agree, when I\\ntell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princess\\nmy sister; but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked,\\nand I was beside myself with rage, I saw to my despair that my\\nfather could not make up his mind to treat the insolent proposal\\nas it deserved', 'I tried to argue with him, but in vain', 'He only\\nbegged me to examine the horse\" with a view (as I quite understood)\\nof making me more sensible of its value', '\"To please my father, I mounted the horse, and, without waiting\\nfor any instructions from the Indian, turned the peg as I had seen\\nhim do', 'In an instant I was soaring upwards, much quicker than\\nan arrow could fly, and I felt as if I must be getting so near\\nthe sky that I should soon hit my head against it', 'I could see\\nnothing beneath me, and for some time was so confused that I\\ndid not even know in what direction I was travelling', 'At last,\\nwhen it was growing dark, I found another screw, and on turning it,\\nthe horse began slowly to sink towards the earth', 'I was forced\\nto trust to chance, and to see what fate had in store, and it was\\nalready past midnight when I found myself on the roof of this palace', 'I crept down the little staircase, and made directly for a light\\nwhich I perceived through an open door--I peeped cautiously in,\\nand saw, as you will guess, the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor', 'I knew the risks I ran, but my need was so great that I paid no\\nattention to them, and stole safely past your guards, to the curtain\\nwhich concealed your doorway', '\"\\n\\n\"The rest, Princess, you know; and it only remains for me to thank you\\nfor the kindness you have shown me, and to assure you of my gratitude', 'By the law of nations, I am already your slave, and I have only\\nmy heart, that is my own, to offer you', 'But what am I saying', 'My own', 'Alas, madame, it was yours from the first moment I\\nbeheld you', '\"\\n\\nThe air with which he said these words could have left no doubt\\non the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms,\\nand the blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty', '\"Prince,\" returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to speak,\\n\"you have given me the greatest pleasure, and I have followed you\\nclosely in all your adventures, and though you are positively\\nsitting before me, I even trembled at your danger in the upper\\nregions of the air', 'Let me say what a debt I owe to the chance\\nthat has led you to my house; you could have entered none which\\nwould have given you a warmer welcome', \"As to your being a slave,\\nof course that is merely a joke, and my reception must itself have\\nassured you that you are as free here as at your father's court\", 'As to your heart,\" continued she in tones of encouragement,\\n\"I am quite sure that must have been disposed of long ago, to some\\nprincess who is well worthy of it, and I could not think of being\\nthe cause of your unfaithfulness to her', '\"\\n\\nPrince Firouz Schah was about to protest that there was no lady\\nwith any prior claims, but he was stopped by the entrance\\nof one of the princess\\'s attendants, who announced that dinner\\nwas served, and, after all, neither was sorry for the interruption', 'Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment, and the table was\\ncovered with delicious fruits; while during the repast richly\\ndressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments', 'After the prince and princess had finished, they passed into a small\\nroom hung with blue and gold, looking out into a garden stocked\\nwith flowers and arbutus trees, quite different from any that were\\nto be found in Persia', '\"Princess,\" observed the young man, \"till now I had always believed\\nthat Persia could boast finer palaces and more lovely gardens\\nthan any kingdom upon earth', 'But my eyes have been opened,\\nand I begin to perceive that, wherever there is a great king\\nhe will surround himself with buildings worthy of him', '\"\\n\\n\"Prince,\" replied the Princess of Bengal, \"I have no idea what\\na Persian palace is like, so I am unable to make comparisons', 'I do not wish to depreciate my own palace, but I can assure you\\nthat it is very poor beside that of the King my father, as you\\nwill agree when you have been there to greet him, as I hope you\\nwill shortly do', '\"\\n\\nNow the princess hoped that, by bringing about a meeting\\nbetween the prince and her father, the King would be so struck\\nwith the young man\\'s distinguished air and fine manners,\\nthat he would offer him his daughter to wife', 'But the reply\\nof the Prince of Persia to her suggestion was not quite what she wished', '\"Madame,\" he said, \"by taking advantage of your proposal to visit the\\npalace of the King of Bengal, I should satisfy not merely my curiosity,\\nbut also the sentiments of respect with which I regard him', 'But, Princess, I am persuaded that you will feel with me, that I\\ncannot possibly present myself before so great a sovereign without\\nthe attendants suitable to my rank', 'He would think me an adventurer', '\"\\n\\n\"If that is all,\" she answered, \"you can get as many attendants\\nhere as you please', 'There are plenty of Persian merchants, and as\\nfor money, my treasury is always open to you', 'Take what you please', '\"\\n\\nPrince Firouz Schah guessed what prompted so much kindness on the part\\nof the princess, and was much touched by it', 'Still his passion,\\nwhich increased every moment, did not make him forget his duty', 'So he replied without hesitation:\\n\\n\"I do not know, Princess, how to express my gratitude for your obliging\\noffer, which I would accept at once if it were not for the recollection\\nof all the uneasiness the King my father must be suffering on my account', 'I should be unworthy indeed of all the love he showers upon me,\\nif I did not return to him at the first possible moment', 'For, while I\\nam enjoying the society of the most amiable of all princesses, he is,\\nI am quite convinced, plunged in the deepest grief, having lost all\\nhope of seeing me again', 'I am sure you will understand my position,\\nand will feel that to remain away one instant longer than is\\nnecessary would not only be ungrateful on my part, but perhaps\\neven a crime, for how do I know if my absence may not break his heart', '\"\\n\\n\"But,\" continued the prince, \"having obeyed the voice of my conscience,\\nI shall count the moments when, with your gracious permission,\\nI may present myself before the King of Bengal, not as a wanderer,\\nbut as a prince, to implore the favour of your hand', 'My father has\\nalways informed me that in my marriage I shall be left quite free,\\nbut I am persuaded that I have only to describe your generosity,\\nfor my wishes to become his own', '\"\\n\\nThe Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not to accept the explanation\\noffered by Prince Firouz Schah, but she was much disturbed at his\\nintention of departing at once, for she feared that, no sooner had he\\nleft her, than the impression she had made on him would fade away', 'So she made one more effort to keep him, and after assuring him\\nthat she entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father,\\nbegged him to give her a day or two more of his company', 'In common politeness the prince could hardly refuse this request,\\nand the princess set about inventing every kind of amusement for him,\\nand succeeded so well that two months slipped by almost unnoticed,\\nin balls, spectacles and in hunting, of which, when unattended\\nby danger, the princess was passionately fond', 'But at last, one day,\\nhe declared seriously that he could neglect his duty no longer,\\nand entreated her to put no further obstacles in his way, promising at\\nthe same time to return, as soon as he could, with all the magnificence\\ndue both to her and to himself', '\"Princess,\" he added, \"it may be that in your heart you class me with\\nthose false lovers whose devotion cannot stand the test of absence', 'If you do, you wrong me; and were it not for fear of offending you,\\nI would beseech you to come with me, for my life can only be happy\\nwhen passed with you', 'As for your reception at the Persian Court,\\nit will be as warm as your merits deserve; and as for what concerns\\nthe King of Bengal, he must be much more indifferent to your welfare\\nthan you have led me to believe if he does not give his consent to\\nour marriage', '\"\\n\\nThe princess could not find words in which to reply to the arguments\\nof the Prince of Persia, but her silence and her downcast eyes spoke\\nfor her, and declared that she had no objection to accompanying\\nhim on his travels', 'The only difficulty that occurred to her was that Prince Firouz\\nSchah did not know how to manage the horse, and she dreaded\\nlest they might find themselves in the same plight as before', 'But the prince soothed her fears so successfully, that she soon\\nhad no other thought than to arrange for their flight so secretly,\\nthat no one in the palace should suspect it', \"This was done, and early the following morning, when the whole palace\\nwas wrapped in sleep, she stole up on to the roof, where the prince\\nwas already awaiting her, with his horse's head towards Persia\", 'He mounted first and helped the princess up behind; then, when she\\nwas firmly seated, with her hands holding tightly to his belt,\\nhe touched the screw, and the horse began to leave the earth quickly\\nbehind him', 'He travelled with his accustomed speed, and Prince Firouz Schah guided\\nhim so well that in two hours and a half from the time of starting,\\nhe saw the capital of Persia lying beneath him', \"He determined\\nto alight neither in the great square from which he had started,\\nnor in the Sultan's palace, but in a country house at a little\\ndistance from the town\", 'Here he showed the princess a beautiful\\nsuite of rooms, and begged her to rest, while he informed his father\\nof their arrival, and prepared a public reception worthy of her rank', 'Then he ordered a horse to be saddled, and set out', 'All the way through the streets he was welcomed with shouts of joy\\nby the people, who had long lost all hope of seeing him again', \"On reaching the palace, he found the Sultan surrounded by his ministers,\\nall clad in the deepest mourning, and his father almost went out of his\\nmind with surprise and delight at the mere sound of his son's voice\", 'When he had calmed down a little, he begged the prince to relate\\nhis adventures', 'The prince at once seized the opening thus given him, and told\\nthe whole story of his treatment by the Princess of Bengal,\\nnot even concealing the fact that she had fallen in love with him', '\"And, Sire,\" ended the prince, \"having given my royal word that you\\nwould not refuse your consent to our marriage, I persuaded her\\nto return with me on the Indian\\'s horse', \"I have left her in one\\nof your Highness's country houses, where she is waiting anxiously\\nto be assured that I have not promised in vain\", '\"\\n\\nAs he said this the prince was about to throw himself at the feet\\nof the Sultan, but his father prevented him, and embracing him again,\\nsaid eagerly:\\n\\n\"My son, not only do I gladly consent to your marriage with the\\nPrincess of Bengal, but I will hasten to pay my respects to her,\\nand to thank her in my own person for the benefits she has\\nconferred on you', 'I will then bring her back with me, and make\\nall arrangements for the wedding to be celebrated to-day', '\"\\n\\nSo the Sultan gave orders that the habits of mourning\\nworn by the people should be thrown off and that there\\nshould be a concert of drums, trumpets and cymbals', 'Also that the Indian should be taken from prison, and brought before him', 'His commands were obeyed, and the Indian was led into his presence,\\nsurrounded by guards', '\"I have kept you locked up,\" said the Sultan,\\n\"so that in case my son was lost, your life should pay the penalty', 'He has now returned; so take your horse, and begone for ever', '\"\\n\\nThe Indian hastily quitted the presence of the Sultan, and when he\\nwas outside, he inquired of the man who had taken him out of prison\\nwhere the prince had really been all this time, and what he had\\nbeen doing', \"They told him the whole story, and how the Princess\\nof Bengal was even then awaiting in the country palace the consent\\nof the Sultan, which at once put into the Indian's head a plan\\nof revenge for the treatment he had experienced\", 'Going straight to\\nthe country house, he informed the doorkeeper who was left in charge\\nthat he had been sent by the Sultan and by the Prince of Persia to\\nfetch the princess on the enchanted horse, and to bring her to the palace', 'The doorkeeper knew the Indian by sight, and was of course aware\\nthat nearly three months before he had been thrown into prison\\nby the Sultan; and seeing him at liberty, the man took for granted\\nthat he was speaking the truth, and made no difficulty about\\nleading him before the Princess of Bengal; while on her side,\\nhearing that he had come from the prince, the lady gladly consented\\nto do what he wished', 'The Indian, delighted with the success of his scheme,\\nmounted the horse, assisted the princess to mount behind him,\\nand turned the peg at the very moment that the prince was leaving\\nthe palace in Schiraz for the country house, followed closely by the\\nSultan and all the court', 'Knowing this, the Indian deliberately\\nsteered the horse right above the city, in order that his revenge\\nfor his unjust imprisonment might be all the quicker and sweeter', 'When the Sultan of Persia saw the horse and its riders, he stopped short\\nwith astonishment and horror, and broke out into oaths and curses,\\nwhich the Indian heard quite unmoved, knowing that he was perfectly\\nsafe from pursuit', 'But mortified and furious as the Sultan was,\\nhis feelings were nothing to those of Prince Firouz Schah, when he\\nsaw the object of his passionate devotion being borne rapidly away', 'And while he was struck speechless with grief and remorse at not\\nhaving guarded her better, she vanished swiftly out of his sight', 'What was he to do', 'Should he follow his father into the palace,\\nand there give reins to his despair', 'Both his love and his courage\\nalike forbade it; and he continued his way to the palace', \"The sight of the prince showed the doorkeeper of what folly he\\nhad been guilty, and flinging himself at his master's feet,\\nimplored his pardon\", '\"Rise,\" said the prince, \"I am the cause of\\nthis misfortune, and not you', 'Go and find me the dress of a dervish,\\nbut beware of saying it is for me', '\"\\n\\nAt a short distance from the country house, a convent of dervishes\\nwas situated, and the superior, or scheih, was the doorkeeper\\'s friend', \"So by means of a false story made up on the spur of the moment,\\nit was easy enough to get hold of a dervish's dress, which the\\nprince at once put on, instead of his own\", 'Disguised like this\\nand concealing about him a box of pearls and diamonds he had intended\\nas a present to the princess, he left the house at nightfall,\\nuncertain where he should go, but firmly resolved not to return\\nwithout her', 'Meanwhile the Indian had turned the horse in such a direction that,\\nbefore many hours had passed, it had entered a wood close to\\nthe capital of the kingdom of Cashmere', 'Feeling very hungry,\\nand supposing that the princess also might be in want of food,\\nhe brought his steed down to the earth, and left the princess\\nin a shady place, on the banks of a clear stream', 'At first, when the princess had found herself alone, the idea\\nhad occurred to her of trying to escape and hide herself', 'But as she had eaten scarcely anything since she had left Bengal,\\nshe felt she was too weak to venture far, and was obliged to\\nabandon her design', 'On the return of the Indian with meats of\\nvarious kinds, she began to eat voraciously, and soon had regained\\nsufficient courage to reply with spirit to his insolent remarks', 'Goaded by his threats she sprang to her feet, calling loudly\\nfor help, and luckily her cries were heard by a troop of horsemen,\\nwho rode up to inquire what was the matter', 'Now the leader of these horsemen was the Sultan of Cashmere,\\nreturning from the chase, and he instantly turned to the Indian\\nto inquire who he was, and whom he had with him', 'The Indian rudely\\nanswered that it was his wife, and there was no occasion for anyone\\nelse to interfere between them', \"The princess, who, of course, was ignorant of the rank of\\nher deliverer, denied altogether the Indian's story\", '\"My lord,\"\\nshe cried, \"whoever you may be, put no faith in this impostor', 'He is an abominable magician, who has this day torn me from the\\nPrince of Persia, my destined husband, and has brought me here on\\nthis enchanted horse', '\"  She would have continued, but her tears\\nchoked her, and the Sultan of Cashmere, convinced by her beauty\\nand her distinguished air of the truth of her tale, ordered his\\nfollowers to cut off the Indian\\'s head, which was done immediately', 'But rescued though she was from one peril, it seemed as if she\\nhad only fallen into another', 'The Sultan commanded a horse to\\nbe given her, and conducted her to his own palace, where he led\\nher to a beautiful apartment, and selected female slaves to wait\\non her, and eunuchs to be her guard', 'Then, without allowing\\nher time to thank him for all he had done, he bade her repose,\\nsaying she should tell him her adventures on the following day', 'The princess fell asleep, flattering herself that she had only\\nto relate her story for the Sultan to be touched by compassion,\\nand to restore her to the prince without delay', 'But a few hours\\nwere to undeceive her', 'When the King of Cashmere had quitted her presence the evening before,\\nhe had resolved that the sun should not set again without the princess\\nbecoming his wife, and at daybreak proclamation of his intention was\\nmade throughout the town, by the sound of drums, trumpets, cymbals,\\nand other instruments calculated to fill the heart with joy', 'The Princess of Bengal was early awakened by the noise, but she did\\nnot for one moment imagine that it had anything to do with her,\\ntill the Sultan, arriving as soon as she was dressed to inquire\\nafter her health, informed her that the trumpet blasts she heard\\nwere part of the solemn marriage ceremonies, for which he begged\\nher to prepare', 'This unexpected announcement caused the princess\\nsuch terror that she sank down in a dead faint', 'The slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid, and the Sultan\\nhimself did his best to bring her back to consciousness, but for\\na long while it was all to no purpose', 'At length her senses\\nbegan slowly to come back to her, and then, rather than break\\nfaith with the Prince of Persia by consenting to such a marriage,\\nshe determined to feign madness', 'So she began by saying all\\nsorts of absurdities, and using all kinds of strange gestures,\\nwhile the Sultan stood watching her with sorrow and surprise', 'But as this sudden seizure showed no sign of abating, he left\\nher to her women, ordering them to take the greatest care of her', 'Still, as the day went on, the malady seemed to become worse,\\nand by night it was almost violent', 'Days passed in this manner, till at last the Sultan of Cashmere\\ndecided to summon all the doctors of his court to consult together\\nover her sad state', 'Their answer was that madness is of so many\\ndifferent kinds that it was impossible to give an opinion on\\nthe case without seeing the princess, so the Sultan gave orders\\nthat they were to be introduced into her chamber, one by one,\\nevery man according to his rank', 'This decision had been foreseen by the princess, who knew quite\\nwell that if once she allowed the physicians to feel her pulse,\\nthe most ignorant of them would discover that she was in perfectly\\ngood health, and that her madness was feigned, so as each man approached,\\nshe broke out into such violent paroxysms, that not one dared to lay\\na finger on her', 'A few, who pretended to be cleverer than the rest,\\ndeclared that they could diagnose sick people only from sight,\\nordered her certain potions, which she made no difficulty about taking,\\nas she was persuaded they were all harmless', 'When the Sultan of Cashmere saw that the court doctors could do\\nnothing towards curing the princess, he called in those of the city,\\nwho fared no better', \"Then he had recourse to the most celebrated\\nphysicians in the other large towns, but finding that the task\\nwas beyond their science, he finally sent messengers into the other\\nneighbouring states, with a memorandum containing full particulars\\nof the princess's madness, offering at the same time to pay\\nthe expenses of any physician who would come and see for himself,\\nand a handsome reward to the one who should cure her\", 'In answer\\nto this proclamation many foreign professors flocked into Cashmere,\\nbut they naturally were not more successful than the rest had been,\\nas the cure depended neither on them nor their skill, but only on\\nthe princess herself', 'It was during this time that Prince Firouz Schah, wandering sadly\\nand hopelessly from place to place, arrived in a large city of India,\\nwhere he heard a great deal of talk about the Princess of Bengal who\\nhad gone out of her senses, on the very day that she was to have been\\nmarried to the Sultan of Cashmere', 'This was quite enough to induce\\nhim to take the road to Cashmere, and to inquire at the first inn\\nat which he lodged in the capital the full particulars of the story', 'When he knew that he had at last found the princess whom he had\\nso long lost, he set about devising a plan for her rescue', \"The first thing he did was to procure a doctor's robe, so that his dress,\\nadded to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his travels,\\nmight unmistakably proclaim his profession\", 'He then lost no time\\nin going to the palace, where he obtained an audience of the\\nchief usher, and while apologising for his boldness in presuming\\nto think that he could cure the princess, where so many others\\nhad failed, declared that he had the secret of certain remedies,\\nwhich had hitherto never failed of their effect', 'The chief usher assured him that he was heartily welcome, and that\\nthe Sultan would receive him with pleasure; and in case of success,\\nhe would gain a magnificent reward', 'When the Prince of Persia, in the disguise of a physician, was brought\\nbefore him, the Sultan wasted no time in talking, beyond remarking\\nthat the mere sight of a doctor threw the princess into transports\\nof rage', 'He then led the prince up to a room under the roof,\\nwhich had an opening through which he might observe the princess,\\nwithout himself being seen', 'The prince looked, and beheld the princess reclining on a sofa\\nwith tears in her eyes, singing softly to herself a song bewailing\\nher sad destiny, which had deprived her, perhaps for ever,\\nof a being she so tenderly loved', \"The young man's heart beat fast\\nas he listened, for he needed no further proof that her madness\\nwas feigned, and that it was love of him which had caused her to\\nresort to this species of trick\", \"He softly left his hiding-place,\\nand returned to the Sultan, to whom he reported that he was sure\\nfrom certain signs that the princess's malady was not incurable,\\nbut that he must see her and speak with her alone\", \"The Sultan made no difficulty in consenting to this, and commanded\\nthat he should be ushered in to the princess's apartment\", \"The moment she caught sight of his physician's robe, she sprang\\nfrom her seat in a fury, and heaped insults upon him\", 'The prince\\ntook no notice of her behaviour, and approaching quite close,\\nso that his words might be heard by her alone, he said in a low whisper,\\n\"Look at me, princess, and you will see that I am no doctor,\\nbut the Prince of Persia, who has come to set you free', '\"\\n\\nAt the sound of his voice, the Princess of Bengal suddenly grew calm,\\nand an expression of joy overspread her face, such as only comes\\nwhen what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly happens\\nto us', 'For some time she was too enchanted to speak, and Prince\\nFirouz Schah took advantage of her silence to explain to her all\\nthat had occurred, his despair at watching her disappear before\\nhis very eyes, the oath he had sworn to follow her over the world,\\nand his rapture at finally discovering her in the palace at Cashmere', 'When he had finished, he begged in his turn that the princess would\\ntell him how she had come there, so that he might the better devise\\nsome means of rescuing her from the tyranny of the Sultan', 'It needed but a few words from the princess to make him acquainted\\nwith the whole situation, and how she had been forced to play the part\\nof a mad woman in order to escape from a marriage with the Sultan,\\nwho had not had sufficient politeness even to ask her consent', 'If necessary, she added, she had resolved to die sooner than permit\\nherself to be forced into such a union, and break faith with a prince\\nwhom she loved', \"The prince then inquired if she knew what had become of the\\nenchanted horse since the Indian's death, but the princess could\\nonly reply that she had heard nothing about it\", 'Still she did\\nnot suppose that the horse could have been forgotten by the Sultan,\\nafter all she had told him of its value', 'To this the prince agreed, and they consulted together over a plan\\nby which she might be able to make her escape and return with him\\ninto Persia', 'And as the first step, she was to dress herself\\nwith care, and receive the Sultan with civility when he visited\\nher next morning', \"The Sultan was transported with delight on learning the result\\nof the interview, and his opinion of the doctor's skill was raised\\nstill higher when, on the following day, the princess behaved\\ntowards him in such a way as to persuade him that her complete\\ncure would not be long delayed\", 'However he contented himself with\\nassuring her how happy he was to see her health so much improved,\\nand exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician,\\nand to repose entire confidence in him', 'Then he retired,\\nwithout awaiting any reply from the princess', \"The Prince of Persia left the room at the same time, and asked\\nif he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the Princess\\nof Bengal had reached Cashmere, which was so far distant from her\\nfather's kingdom, and how she came to be there alone\", 'The Sultan\\nthought the question very natural, and told him the same story\\nthat the Princess of Bengal had done, adding that he had ordered\\nthe enchanted horse to be taken to his treasury as a curiosity,\\nthough he was quite ignorant how it could be used', '\"Sire,\" replied the physician, \"your Highness\\'s tale has supplied me\\nwith the clue I needed to complete the recovery of the princess', 'During her voyage hither on an enchanted horse, a portion of its\\nenchantment has by some means been communicated to her person,\\nand it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which I possess\\nthe secret', 'If your Highness will deign to consent, and to give\\nthe court and the people one of the most astonishing spectacles they\\nhave ever witnessed, command the horse to be brought into the big\\nsquare outside the palace, and leave the rest to me', 'I promise that\\nin a very few moments, in presence of all the assembled multitude,\\nyou shall see the princess as healthy both in mind and body as ever\\nshe was in her life', 'And in order to make the spectacle as impressive\\nas possible, I would suggest that she should be richly dressed\\nand covered with the noblest jewels of the crown', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan readily agreed to all that the prince proposed,\\nand the following morning he desired that the enchanted horse\\nshould be taken from the treasury, and brought into the great square\\nof the palace', 'Soon the rumour began to spread through the town,\\nthat something extraordinary was about to happen, and such a crowd\\nbegan to collect that the guards had to be called out to keep order,\\nand to make a way for the enchanted horse', 'When all was ready, the Sultan appeared, and took his place on\\na platform, surrounded by the chief nobles and officers of his court', 'When they were seated, the Princess of Bengal was seen leaving\\nthe palace, accompanied by the ladies who had been assigned\\nto her by the Sultan', 'She slowly approached the enchanted horse,\\nand with the help of her ladies, she mounted on its back', 'Directly she was in the saddle, with her feet in the stirrups\\nand the bridle in her hand, the physician placed around the horse\\nsome large braziers full of burning coals, into each of which he\\nthrew a perfume composed of all sorts of delicious scents', 'Then he\\ncrossed his hands over his breast, and with lowered eyes walked\\nthree times round the horse, muttering the while certain words', 'Soon there arose from the burning braziers a thick smoke which almost\\nconcealed both the horse and princess, and this was the moment for\\nwhich he had been waiting', 'Springing lightly up behind the lady,\\nhe leaned forward and turned the peg, and as the horse darted up into\\nthe air, he cried aloud so that his words were heard by all present,\\n\"Sultan of Cashmere, when you wish to marry princesses who have\\nsought your protection, learn first to gain their consent', '\"\\n\\nIt was in this way that the Prince of Persia rescued the Princess\\nof Bengal, and returned with her to Persia, where they descended\\nthis time before the palace of the King himself', 'The marriage\\nwas only delayed just long enough to make the ceremony as brilliant\\nas possible, and, as soon as the rejoicings were over, an ambassador\\nwas sent to the King of Bengal, to inform him of what had passed,\\nand to ask his approbation of the alliance between the two countries,\\nwhich he heartily gave', 'The Story of Two Sisters Who Were Jealous of Their Younger Sister\\n\\n\\nOnce upon a time there reigned over Persia a Sultan named Kosrouschah,\\nwho from his boyhood had been fond of putting on a disguise and seeking\\nadventures in all parts of the city, accompanied by one of his officers,\\ndisguised like himself', 'And no sooner was his father buried\\nand the ceremonies over that marked his accession to the throne,\\nthan the young man hastened to throw off his robes of state,\\nand calling to his vizir to make ready likewise, stole out in the simple\\ndress of a private citizen into the less known streets of the capital', \"Passing down a lonely street, the Sultan heard women's voices\\nin loud discussion; and peeping through a crack in the door, he saw\\nthree sisters, sitting on a sofa in a large hall, talking in a very\\nlively and earnest manner\", 'Judging from the few words that reached\\nhis ear, they were each explaining what sort of men they wished to marry', '\"I ask nothing better,\" cried the eldest, \"than to have the Sultan\\'s\\nbaker for a husband', 'Think of being able to eat as much as one wanted,\\nof that delicious bread that is baked for his Highness alone', 'Let us see if your wish is as good as mine', '\"\\n\\n\"I,\" replied the second sister, \"should be quite content\\nwith the Sultan\\'s head cook', 'What delicate stews I should\\nfeast upon', \"And, as I am persuaded that the Sultan's bread is used\\nall through the palace, I should have that into the bargain\", 'You see, my dear sister, my taste is as good as yours', '\"\\n\\nIt was now the turn of the youngest sister, who was by far the most\\nbeautiful of the three, and had, besides, more sense than the\\nother two', '\"As for me,\" she said, \"I should take a higher flight;\\nand if we are to wish for husbands, nothing less than the Sultan\\nhimself will do for me', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan was so much amused by the conversation he had overheard,\\nthat he made up his mind to gratify their wishes, and turning to\\nthe grand-vizir, he bade him note the house, and on the following\\nmorning to bring the ladies into his presence', 'The grand-vizir fulfilled his commission, and hardly giving\\nthem time to change their dresses, desired the three sisters\\nto follow him to the palace', 'Here they were presented one by one,\\nand when they had bowed before the Sultan, the sovereign abruptly\\nput the question to them:\\n\\n\"Tell me, do you remember what you wished for last night, when you\\nwere making merry', 'Fear nothing, but answer me the truth', '\"\\n\\nThese words, which were so unexpected, threw the sisters into\\ngreat confusion, their eyes fell, and the blushes of the youngest\\ndid not fail to make an impression on the heart of the Sultan', 'All three remained silent, and he hastened to continue:  \"Do not\\nbe afraid, I have not the slightest intention of giving you pain,\\nand let me tell you at once, that I know the wishes formed by\\neach one', 'You,\" he said, turning to the youngest, \"who desired to\\nhave me for an husband, shall be satisfied this very day', 'And you,\"\\nhe added, addressing himself to the other two, \"shall be married\\nat the same moment to my baker and to my chief cook', '\"\\n\\nWhen the Sultan had finished speaking the three sisters flung\\nthemselves at his feet, and the youngest faltered out, \"Oh, sire,\\nsince you know my foolish words, believe, I pray you, that they were\\nonly said in joke', 'I am unworthy of the honour you propose to do me,\\nand I can only ask pardon for my boldness', '\"\\n\\nThe other sisters also tried to excuse themselves, but the Sultan\\nwould hear nothing', '\"No, no,\" he said, \"my mind is made up', 'Your wishes shall\\nbe accomplished', '\"\\n\\nSo the three weddings were celebrated that same day, but with a\\ngreat difference', \"That of the youngest was marked by all the\\nmagnificence that was customary at the marriage of the Shah of Persia,\\nwhile the festivities attending the nuptials of the Sultan's baker\\nand his chief cook were only such as were suitable to their conditions\", 'This, though quite natural, was highly displeasing to the elder\\nsisters, who fell into a passion of jealousy, which in the end\\ncaused a great deal of trouble and pain to several people', 'And the first time that they had the opportunity of speaking to\\neach other, which was not till several days later at a public bath,\\nthey did not attempt to disguise their feelings', '\"Can you possibly understand what the Sultan saw in that little cat,\"\\nsaid one to the other, \"for him to be so fascinated by her', '\"\\n\\n\"He must be quite blind,\" returned the wife of the chief cook', '\"As for her looking a little younger than we do, what does that matter', 'You would have made a far better Sultana than she', '\"\\n\\n\"Oh, I say nothing of myself,\" replied the elder, \"and if the\\nSultan had chosen you it would have been all very well; but it\\nreally grieves me that he should have selected a wretched little\\ncreature like that', 'However, I will be revenged on her somehow,\\nand I beg you will give me your help in the matter, and to tell\\nme anything that you can think of that is likely to mortify her', '\"\\n\\nIn order to carry out their wicked scheme the two sisters met\\nconstantly to talk over their ideas, though all the while they\\npretended to be as friendly as ever towards the Sultana, who,\\non her part, invariably treated them with kindness', 'For a long\\ntime no plan occurred to the two plotters that seemed in the\\nleast likely to meet with success, but at length the expected\\nbirth of an heir gave them the chance for which they had been hoping', 'They obtained permission of the Sultan to take up their abode in the\\npalace for some weeks, and never left their sister night or day', 'When at last a little boy, beautiful as the sun, was born, they laid\\nhim in his cradle and carried it down to a canal which passed\\nthrough the grounds of the palace', 'Then, leaving it to its fate,\\nthey informed the Sultan that instead of the son he had so fondly\\ndesired the Sultana had given birth to a puppy', 'At this dreadful\\nnews the Sultan was so overcome with rage and grief that it was with\\ngreat difficulty that the grand-vizir managed to save the Sultana\\nfrom his wrath', 'Meanwhile the cradle continued to float peacefully along the canal till,\\non the outskirts of the royal gardens, it was suddenly perceived\\nby the intendant, one of the highest and most respected officials\\nin the kingdom', '\"Go,\" he said to a gardener who was working near, \"and get that\\ncradle out for me', '\"\\n\\nThe gardener did as he was bid, and soon placed the cradle\\nin the hands of the intendant', 'The official was much astonished to see that the cradle, which he had\\nsupposed to be empty, contained a baby, which, young though it was,\\nalready gave promise of great beauty', 'Having no children himself,\\nalthough he had been married some years, it at once occurred to him\\nthat here was a child which he could take and bring up as his own', 'And, bidding the man pick up the cradle and follow him, he turned\\ntowards home', '\"My wife,\" he exclaimed as he entered the room, \"heaven has denied\\nus any children, but here is one that has been sent in their place', 'Send for a nurse, and I will do what is needful publicly to recognise\\nit as my son', '\"\\n\\nThe wife accepted the baby with joy, and though the intendant saw\\nquite well that it must have come from the royal palace, he did\\nnot think it was his business to inquire further into the mystery', 'The following year another prince was born and sent adrift,\\nbut happily for the baby, the intendant of the gardens again\\nwas walking by the canal, and carried it home as before', 'The Sultan, naturally enough, was still more furious the second time\\nthan the first, but when the same curious accident was repeated\\nin the third year he could control himself no longer, and, to the\\ngreat joy of the jealous sisters, commanded that the Sultana should\\nbe executed', \"But the poor lady was so much beloved at Court that not\\neven the dread of sharing her fate could prevent the grand-vizir\\nand the courtiers from throwing themselves at the Sultan's feet\\nand imploring him not to inflict so cruel a punishment for what,\\nafter all, was not her fault\", '\"Let her live,\" entreated the grand-vizir, \"and banish her\\nfrom your presence for the rest of her days', 'That in itself\\nwill be punishment enough', '\"\\n\\nHis first passion spent, the Sultan had regained his self-command', '\"Let her live then,\" he said, \"since you have it so much at heart', 'But if I grant her life it shall only be on one condition, which shall\\nmake her daily pray for death', 'Let a box be built for her at the door\\nof the principal mosque, and let the window of the box be always open', 'There she shall sit, in the coarsest clothes, and every Mussulman\\nwho enters the mosque shall spit in her face in passing', 'Anyone that\\nrefuses to obey shall be exposed to the same punishment himself', 'You, vizir, will see that my orders are carried out', '\"\\n\\nThe grand-vizir saw that it was useless to say more, and, full of triumph,\\nthe sisters watched the building of the box, and then listened to the\\njeers of the people at the helpless Sultana sitting inside', 'But the poor\\nlady bore herself with so much dignity and meekness that it was not long\\nbefore she had won the sympathy of those that were best among the crowd', 'But it is now-time to return to the fate of the third baby,\\nthis time a princess', 'Like its brothers, it was found by the\\nintendant of the gardens, and adopted by him and his wife,\\nand all three were brought up with the greatest care and tenderness', 'As the children grew older their beauty and air of distinction\\nbecame more and more marked, and their manners had all the grace\\nand ease that is proper to people of high birth', 'The princes had\\nbeen named by their foster-father Bahman and Perviz, after two of\\nthe ancient kings of Persia, while the princess was called Parizade,\\nor the child of the genii', 'The intendant was careful to bring them up as befitted their\\nreal rank, and soon appointed a tutor to teach the young princes\\nhow to read and write', 'And the princess, determined not to be\\nleft behind, showed herself so anxious to learn with her brothers,\\nthat the intendant consented to her joining in their lessons,\\nand it was not long before she knew as much as they did', 'From that time all their studies were done in common', 'They had the best\\nmasters for the fine arts, geography, poetry, history and science,\\nand even for sciences which are learned by few, and every branch seemed\\nso easy to them, that their teachers were astonished at the progress\\nthey made', 'The princess had a passion for music, and could sing\\nand play upon all sorts of instruments she could also ride and drive\\nas well as her brothers, shoot with a bow and arrow, and throw\\na javelin with the same skill as they, and sometimes even better', 'In order to set off these accomplishments, the intendant resolved\\nthat his foster children should not be pent up any longer in the\\nnarrow borders of the palace gardens, where he had always lived,\\nso he bought a splendid country house a few miles from the capital,\\nsurrounded by an immense park', 'This park he filled with wild beasts\\nof various sorts, so that the princes and princess might hunt as much\\nas they pleased', \"When everything was ready, the intendant threw himself at the\\nSultan's feet, and after referring to his age and his long services,\\nbegged his Highness's permission to resign his post\", 'This was granted\\nby the Sultan in a few gracious words, and he then inquired what reward\\nhe could give to his faithful servant', \"But the intendant declared that\\nhe wished for nothing except the continuance of his Highness's favour,\\nand prostrating himself once more, he retired from the Sultan's presence\", 'Five or six months passed away in the pleasures of the country,\\nwhen death attacked the intendant so suddenly that he had no time\\nto reveal the secret of their birth to his adopted children,\\nand as his wife had long been dead also, it seemed as if the princes\\nand the princess would never know that they had been born to a\\nhigher station than the one they filled', 'Their sorrow for their\\nfather was very deep, and they lived quietly on in their new home,\\nwithout feeling any desire to leave it for court gaieties or intrigues', 'One day the princes as usual went out to hunt, but their sister\\nremained alone in her apartments', 'While they were gone an old\\nMussulman devotee appeared at the door, and asked leave to enter,\\nas it was the hour of prayer', 'The princess sent orders at once that\\nthe old woman was to be taken to the private oratory in the grounds,\\nand when she had finished her prayers was to be shown the house\\nand gardens, and then to be brought before her', 'Although the old woman was very pious, she was not at all\\nindifferent to the magnificence of all around her, which she\\nseemed to understand as well as to admire, and when she had\\nseen it all she was led by the servants before the princess,\\nwho was seated in a room which surpassed in splendour all the rest', '\"My good woman,\" said the princess pointing to a sofa, \"come and sit\\nbeside me', 'I am delighted at the opportunity of speaking for a few\\nmoments with so holy a person', '\"  The old woman made some objections\\nto so much honour being done her, but the princess refused to listen,\\nand insisted that her guest should take the best seat, and as she\\nthought she must be tired ordered refreshments', 'While the old woman was eating, the princess put several questions\\nto her as to her mode of life, and the pious exercises she practiced,\\nand then inquired what she thought of the house now that she had\\nseen it', '\"Madam,\" replied the pilgrim, \"one must be hard indeed to please\\nto find any fault', 'It is beautiful, comfortable and well ordered,\\nand it is impossible to imagine anything more lovely than the garden', 'But since you ask me, I must confess that it lacks three things\\nto make it absolutely perfect', '\"\\n\\n\"And what can they be', '\" cried the princess', '\"Only tell me, and I\\nwill lose no time in getting them', '\"\\n\\n\"The three things, madam,\" replied the old woman, \"are, first,\\nthe Talking Bird, whose voice draws all other singing birds to it,\\nto join in chorus', 'And second, the Singing Tree, where every leaf\\nis a song that is never silent', 'And lastly the Golden Water,\\nof which it is only needful to pour a single drop into a basin\\nfor it to shoot up into a fountain, which will never be exhausted,\\nnor will the basin ever overflow', '\"\\n\\n\"Oh, how can I thank you,\" cried the princess, \"for telling me of\\nsuch treasures', 'But add, I pray you', 'to your goodness by further\\ninforming me where I can find them', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" replied the pilgrim, \"I should ill repay the hospitality\\nyou have shown me if I refused to answer your question', 'The three\\nthings of which I have spoken are all to be found in one place,\\non the borders of this kingdom, towards India', 'Your messenger has\\nonly to follow the road that passes by your house, for twenty days,\\nand at the end of that time, he is to ask the first person he meets\\nfor the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water', '\" \\nShe then rose, and bidding farewell to the princess, went her way', 'The old woman had taken her departure so abruptly that the Princess\\nParizade did not perceive till she was really gone that the directions\\nwere hardly clear enough to enable the search to be successful', 'And she was still thinking of the subject, and how delightful it\\nwould be to possess such rarities, when the princes, her brothers,\\nreturned from the chase', '\"What is the matter, my sister', '\" asked Prince Bahman; \"why are you\\nso grave', 'Are you ill', 'or has anything happened', '\"\\n\\nPrincess Parizade did not answer directly, but at length she raised\\nher eyes, and replied that there was nothing wrong', '\"But there must be something,\" persisted Prince Bahman, \"for you\\nto have changed so much during the short time we have been absent', 'Hide nothing from us, I beseech you, unless you wish us to believe\\nthat the confidence we have always had in one another is now\\nto cease', '\"\\n\\n\"When I said that it was nothing,\" said the princess, moved by\\nhis words, \"I meant that it was nothing that affected you, although I\\nadmit that it is certainly of some importance to me', 'Like myself,\\nyou have always thought this house that our father built for us was\\nperfect in every respect, but only to-day I have learned that three\\nthings are still lacking to complete it', 'These are the Talking Bird,\\nthe Singing Tree, and the Golden Water', '\"  After explaining the peculiar\\nqualities of each, the princess continued:  \"It was a Mussulman\\ndevotee who told me all this, and where they might all be found', 'Perhaps you will think that the house is beautiful enough as it is,\\nand that we can do quite well without them; but in this I cannot\\nagree with you, and I shall never be content until I have got them', 'So counsel me, I pray, whom to send on the undertaking', '\"\\n\\n\"My dear sister,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"that you should care\\nabout the matter is quite enough, even if we took no interest in\\nit ourselves', 'But we both feel with you, and I claim, as the elder,\\nthe right to make the first attempt, if you will tell me where I\\nam to go, and what steps I am to take', '\"\\n\\nPrince Perviz at first objected that, being the head of the family,\\nhis brother ought not to be allowed to expose himself to danger;\\nbut Prince Bahman would hear nothing, and retired to make the needful\\npreparations for his journey', 'The next morning Prince Bahman got up very early, and after\\nbidding farewell to his brother and sister, mounted his horse', 'But just as he was about to touch it with his whip, he was stopped\\nby a cry from the princess', '\"Oh, perhaps after all you may never come back; one never can tell\\nwhat accidents may happen', 'Give it up, I implore you, for I would\\na thousand times rather lose the Talking Bird, and the Singing Tree\\nand the Golden Water, than that you should run into danger', '\"\\n\\n\"My dear sister,\" answered the prince, \"accidents only happen\\nto unlucky people, and I hope that I am not one of them', 'But as everything is uncertain, I promise you to be very careful', 'Take this knife,\" he continued, handing her one that hung sheathed\\nfrom his belt, \"and every now and then draw it out and look at it', 'As long as it keeps bright and clean as it is to-day, you will know\\nthat I am living; but if the blade is spotted with blood, it will be\\na sign that I am dead, and you shall weep for me', '\"\\n\\nSo saying, Prince Bahman bade them farewell once more, and started\\non the high road, well mounted and fully armed', 'For twenty days he\\nrode straight on, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left,\\ntill he found himself drawing near the frontiers of Persia', 'Seated under a tree by the wayside he noticed a hideous old man,\\nwith a long white moustache, and beard that almost fell to his feet', 'His nails had grown to an enormous length, and on his head he wore a\\nhuge hat, which served him for an umbrella', 'Prince Bahman, who, remembering the directions of the old woman,\\nhad been since sunrise on the look-out for some one, recognised the\\nold man at once to be a dervish', 'He dismounted from his horse,\\nand bowed low before the holy man, saying by way of greeting,\\n\"My father, may your days be long in the land, and may all your wishes\\nbe fulfilled', '\"\\n\\nThe dervish did his best to reply, but his moustache was so thick that\\nhis words were hardly intelligible, and the prince, perceiving what\\nwas the matter, took a pair of scissors from his saddle pockets,\\nand requested permission to cut off some of the moustache, as he had\\na question of great importance to ask the dervish', 'The dervish made\\na sign that he might do as he liked, and when a few inches of his hair\\nand beard had been pruned all round the prince assured the holy man\\nthat he would hardly believe how much younger he looked', 'The dervish\\nsmiled at his compliments, and thanked him for what he had done', '\"Let me,\" he said, \"show you my gratitude for making me more\\ncomfortable by telling me what I can do for you', '\"\\n\\n\"Gentle dervish,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"I come from far, and I\\nseek the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water', 'I know that they are to be found somewhere in these parts, but I am\\nignorant of the exact spot', 'Tell me, I pray you, if you can, so that I\\nmay not have travelled on a useless quest', '\"  While he was speaking,\\nthe prince observed a change in the countenance of the dervish,\\nwho waited for some time before he made reply', '\"My lord,\" he said at last, \"I do know the road for which you ask,\\nbut your kindness and the friendship I have conceived for you make\\nme loth to point it out', '\"\\n\\n\"But why not', '\" inquired the prince', '\"What danger can there be', '\"\\n\\n\"The very greatest danger,\" answered the dervish', '\"Other men,\\nas brave as you, have ridden down this road, and have put me\\nthat question', 'I did my best to turn them also from their purpose,\\nbut it was of no use', 'Not one of them would listen to my words,\\nand not one of them came back', 'Be warned in time, and seek to go\\nno further', '\"\\n\\n\"I am grateful to you for your interest in me,\" said Prince Bahman,\\n\"and for the advice you have given, though I cannot follow it', 'But what dangers can there be in the adventure which courage and a good\\nsword cannot meet', '\"\\n\\n\"And suppose,\" answered the dervish, \"that your enemies are invisible,\\nhow then', '\"\\n\\n\"Nothing will make me give it up,\" replied the prince, \"and for\\nthe last time I ask you to tell me where I am to go', '\"\\n\\nWhen the dervish saw that the prince\\'s mind was made up,\\nhe drew a ball from a bag that lay near him, and held it out', '\"If it must be so,\" he said, with a sigh, \"take this, and when\\nyou have mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you', 'It will roll on till it reaches the foot of a mountain, and when it\\nstops you will stop also', \"You will then throw the bridle on your\\nhorse's neck without any fear of his straying, and will dismount\", 'On each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones,\\nand will hear a multitude of insulting voices, but pay no heed\\nto them, and, above all, beware of ever turning your head', 'If you do, you will instantly become a black stone like the rest', 'For those stones are in reality men like yourself, who have been on\\nthe same quest, and have failed, as I fear that you may fail also', 'If you manage to avoid this pitfall, and to reach the top of\\nthe mountain, you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage,\\nand you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree and\\nthe Golden Water', 'That is all I have to say', 'You know what you\\nhave to do, and what to avoid, but if you are wise you will think\\nof it no more, but return whence you have come', '\"\\n\\nThe prince smilingly shook his head, and thanking the dervish\\nonce more, he sprang on his horse and threw the ball before him', 'The ball rolled along the road so fast that Prince Bahman had much\\ndifficulty in keeping up with it, and it never relaxed its speed\\ntill the foot of the mountain was reached', \"Then it came to a\\nsudden halt, and the prince at once got down and flung the bridle\\non his horse's neck\", 'He paused for a moment and looked round him\\nat the masses of black stones with which the sides of the mountain\\nwere covered, and then began resolutely to ascend', 'He had hardly\\ngone four steps when he heard the sound of voices around him,\\nalthough not another creature was in sight', '\"Who is this imbecile', '\" cried some, \"stop him at once', '\"  \"Kill him,\"\\nshrieked others, \"Help', 'robbers', 'murderers', 'help', 'help', '\"  \"Oh, let\\nhim alone,\" sneered another, and this was the most trying of all,\\n\"he is such a beautiful young man; I am sure the bird and the cage\\nmust have been kept for him', '\"\\n\\nAt first the prince took no heed to all this clamour, but continued\\nto press forward on his way', 'Unfortunately this conduct, instead of\\nsilencing the voices, only seemed to irritate them the more,\\nand they arose with redoubled fury, in front as well as behind', 'After some time he grew bewildered, his knees began to tremble,\\nand finding himself in the act of falling, he forgot altogether\\nthe advice of the dervish', 'He turned to fly down the mountain,\\nand in one moment became a black stone', 'As may be imagined, Prince Perviz and his sister were all this\\ntime in the greatest anxiety, and consulted the magic knife,\\nnot once but many times a day', 'Hitherto the blade had remained\\nbright and spotless, but on the fatal hour on which Prince Bahman\\nand his horse were changed into black stones, large drops of blood\\nappeared on the surface', '\"Ah', 'my beloved brother,\" cried the princess\\nin horror, throwing the knife from her, \"I shall never see you again,\\nand it is I who have killed you', 'Fool that I was to listen to the\\nvoice of that temptress, who probably was not speaking the truth', 'What are the Talking Bird and the Singing Tree to me in comparison\\nwith you, passionately though I long for them', '\"\\n\\nPrince Perviz\\'s grief at his brother\\'s loss was not less than that of\\nPrincess Parizade, but he did not waste his time on useless lamentations', '\"My sister,\" he said, \"why should you think the old woman was deceiving\\nyou about these treasures, and what would have been her object in\\ndoing so', 'No, no, our brother must have met his death by some accident,\\nor want of precaution, and to-morrow I will start on the same quest', '\"\\n\\nTerrified at the thought that she might lose her only remaining\\nbrother, the princess entreated him to give up his project,\\nbut he remained firm', 'Before setting out, however, he gave her a\\nchaplet of a hundred pearls, and said, \"When I am absent, tell this\\nover daily for me', \"But if you should find that the beads stick,\\nso that they will not slip one after the other, you will know that\\nmy brother's fate has befallen me\", 'Still, we must hope for better luck', '\"\\n\\nThen he departed, and on the twentieth day of his journey fell\\nin with the dervish on the same spot as Prince Bahman had met him,\\nand began to question him as to the place where the Talking Bird,\\nthe Singing Tree and the Golden Water were to be found', 'As in the case\\nof his brother, the dervish tried to make him give up his project,\\nand even told him that only a few weeks since a young man,\\nbearing a strong resemblance to him-self, had passed that way,\\nbut had never come back again', '\"That, holy dervish,\" replied Prince Perviz, \"was my elder brother,\\nwho is now dead, though how he died I cannot say', '\"\\n\\n\"He is changed into a black stone,\" answered the dervish, \"like all\\nthe rest who have gone on the same errand, and you will become one\\nlikewise if you are not more careful in following my directions', '\" \\nThen he charged the prince, as he valued his life, to take no heed\\nof the clamour of voices that would pursue him up the mountain,\\nand handing him a ball from the bag, which still seemed to be half full,\\nhe sent him on his way', 'When Prince Perviz reached the foot of the mountain he jumped from\\nhis horse, and paused for a moment to recall the instructions the\\ndervish had given him', 'Then he strode boldly on, but had scarcely\\ngone five or six paces when he was startled by a man\\'s voice\\nthat seemed close to his ear, exclaiming:  \"Stop, rash fellow,\\nand let me punish your audacity', '\"  This outrage entirely put\\nthe dervish\\'s advice out of the prince\\'s head', 'He drew his sword,\\nand turned to avenge himself, but almost before he had realised\\nthat there was nobody there, he and his horse were two black stones', \"Not a morning had passed since Prince Perviz had ridden away without\\nPrincess Parizade telling her beads, and at night she even hung\\nthem round her neck, so that if she woke she could assure herself\\nat once of her brother's safety\", 'She was in the very act of moving\\nthem through her fingers at the moment that the prince fell a victim\\nto his impatience, and her heart sank when the first pearl remained\\nfixed in its place', 'However she had long made up her mind what she\\nwould do in such a case, and the following morning the princess,\\ndisguised as a man, set out for the mountain', 'As she had been accustomed to riding from her childhood, she managed\\nto travel as many miles daily as her brothers had done, and it was,\\nas before, on the twentieth day that she arrived at the place\\nwhere the dervish was sitting', '\"Good dervish,\" she said politely,\\n\"will you allow me to rest by you for a few moments, and perhaps you\\nwill be so kind as to tell me if you have ever heard of a Talking Bird,\\na Singing Tree, and some Golden Water that are to be found somewhere\\nnear this', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" replied the dervish, \"for in spite of your manly dress your\\nvoice betrays you, I shall be proud to serve you in any way I can', 'But may I ask the purpose of your question', '\"\\n\\n\"Good dervish,\" answered the princess, \"I have heard such glowing\\ndescriptions of these three things, that I cannot rest till I\\npossess them', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" said the dervish, \"they are far more beautiful than\\nany description, but you seem ignorant of all the difficulties\\nthat stand in your way, or you would hardly have undertaken\\nsuch an adventure', 'Give it up, I pray you, and return home,\\nand do not ask me to help you to a cruel death', '\"\\n\\n\"Holy father,\" answered the princess, \"I come from far, and I should\\nbe in despair if I turned back without having attained my object', 'You have spoken of difficulties; tell me, I entreat you, what they are,\\nso that I may know if I can overcome them, or see if they are beyond\\nmy strength', '\"\\n\\nSo the dervish repeated his tale, and dwelt more firmly than before\\non the clamour of the voices, the horrors of the black stones,\\nwhich were once living men, and the difficulties of climbing\\nthe mountain; and pointed out that the chief means of success\\nwas never to look behind till you had the cage in your grasp', '\"As far as I can see,\" said the princess, \"the first thing is not\\nto mind the tumult of the voices that follow you till you reach\\nthe cage, and then never to look behind', 'As to this, I think I\\nhave enough self-control to look straight before me; but as it is\\nquite possible that I might be frightened by the voices, as even the\\nboldest men have been, I will stop up my ears with cotton, so that,\\nlet them make as much noise as they like, I shall hear nothing', '\"\\n\\n\"Madam,\" cried the dervish, \"out of all the number who have asked me\\nthe way to the mountain, you are the first who has ever suggested\\nsuch a means of escaping the danger', 'It is possible that you\\nmay succeed, but all the same, the risk is great', '\"\\n\\n\"Good dervish,\" answered the princess, \"I feel in my heart that I\\nshall succeed, and it only remains for me to ask you the way I am\\nto go', '\"\\n\\nThen the dervish said that it was useless to say more, and he gave\\nher the ball, which she flung before her', 'The first thing the princess did on arriving at the mountain was\\nto stop her ears with cotton, and then, making up her mind which was\\nthe best way to go, she began her ascent', 'In spite of the cotton,\\nsome echoes of the voices reached her ears, but not so as to trouble her', 'Indeed, though they grew louder and more insulting the higher she climbed,\\nthe princess only laughed, and said to herself that she certainly\\nwould not let a few rough words stand between her and the goal', 'At last she perceived in the distance the cage and the bird,\\nwhose voice joined itself in tones of thunder to those of the rest: \\n\"Return, return', 'never dare to come near me', '\"\\n\\nAt the sight of the bird, the princess hastened her steps, and without\\nvexing herself at the noise which by this time had grown deafening,\\nshe walked straight up to the cage, and seizing it, she said: \\n\"Now, my bird, I have got you, and I shall take good care that you\\ndo not escape', '\"  As she spoke she took the cotton from her ears,\\nfor it was needed no longer', '\"Brave lady,\" answered the bird, \"do not blame me for having joined\\nmy voice to those who did their best to preserve my freedom', 'Although confined in a cage, I was content with my lot, but if I\\nmust become a slave, I could not wish for a nobler mistress than\\none who has shown so much constancy, and from this moment I swear\\nto serve you faithfully', 'Some day you will put me to the proof,\\nfor I know who you are better than you do yourself', 'Meanwhile, tell me\\nwhat I can do, and I will obey you', '\"\\n\\n\"Bird,\" replied the princess, who was filled with a joy that seemed\\nstrange to herself when she thought that the bird had cost her the\\nlives of both her brothers', '\"bird, let me first thank you for your\\ngood will, and then let me ask you where the Golden Water is to be found', '\"\\n\\nThe bird described the place, which was not far distant, and the\\nprincess filled a small silver flask that she had brought with her\\nfor the purpose', 'She then returned to the cage, and said:  \"Bird,\\nthere is still something else, where shall I find the Singing Tree', '\"\\n\\n\"Behind you, in that wood,\" replied the bird, and the princess\\nwandered through the wood, till a sound of the sweetest voices told\\nher she had found what she sought', 'But the tree was tall and strong,\\nand it was hopeless to think of uprooting it', '\"You need not do that,\" said the bird, when she had returned\\nto ask counsel', '\"Break off a twig, and plant it in your garden,\\nand it will take root, and grow into a magnificent tree', '\"\\n\\nWhen the Princess Parizade held in her hands the three wonders\\npromised her by the old woman, she said to the bird:  \"All that is\\nnot enough', 'It was owing to you that my brothers became black stones', 'I cannot tell them from the mass of others, but you must know,\\nand point them out to me, I beg you, for I wish to carry them away', '\"\\n\\nFor some reason that the princess could not guess these words seemed\\nto displease the bird, and he did not answer', 'The princess waited\\na moment, and then continued in severe tones, \"Have you forgotten\\nthat you yourself said that you are my slave to do my bidding,\\nand also that your life is in my power', '\"\\n\\n\"No, I have not forgotten,\" replied the bird, \"but what you ask is\\nvery difficult', 'However, I will do my best', 'If you look round,\"\\nhe went on, \"you will see a pitcher standing near', 'Take it, and, as you\\ngo down the mountain, scatter a little of the water it contains\\nover every black stone and you will soon find your two brothers', '\"\\n\\nPrincess Parizade took the pitcher, and, carrying with her besides\\nthe cage the twig and the flask, returned down the mountain side', 'At every black stone she stopped and sprinkled it with water,\\nand as the water touched it the stone instantly became a man', 'When she suddenly saw her brothers before her her delight was mixed\\nwith astonishment', '\"Why, what are you doing here', '\" she cried', '\"We have been asleep,\" they said', '\"Yes,\" returned the princess, \"but without me your sleep would\\nprobably have lasted till the day of judgment', 'Have you forgotten\\nthat you came here in search of the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree,\\nand the Golden Water, and the black stones that were heaped\\nup along the road', 'Look round and see if there is one left', 'These gentlemen, and yourselves, and all your horses were changed\\ninto these stones, and I have delivered you by sprinkling you with\\nthe water from this pitcher', 'As I could not return home without you,\\neven though I had gained the prizes on which I had set my heart,\\nI forced the Talking Bird to tell me how to break the spell', '\"\\n\\nOn hearing these words Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz understood\\nall they owed their sister, and the knights who stood by declared\\nthemselves her slaves and ready to carry out her wishes', 'But the princess, while thanking them for their politeness,\\nexplained that she wished for no company but that of her brothers,\\nand that the rest were free to go where they would', 'So saying the princess mounted her horse, and, declining to allow\\neven Prince Bahman to carry the cage with the Talking Bird,\\nshe entrusted him with the branch of the Singing Tree, while Prince\\nPerviz took care of the flask containing the Golden Water', 'Then they rode away, followed by the knights and gentlemen,\\nwho begged to be permitted to escort them', 'It had been the intention of the party to stop and tell their\\nadventures to the dervish, but they found to their sorrow that he\\nwas dead, whether from old age, or whether from the feeling\\nthat his task was done, they never knew', 'As they continued their road their numbers grew daily smaller,\\nfor the knights turned off one by one to their own homes, and only\\nthe brothers and sister finally drew up at the gate of the palace', 'The princess carried the cage straight into the garden, and, as soon\\nas the bird began to sing, nightingales, larks, thrushes, finches,\\nand all sorts of other birds mingled their voices in chorus', 'The branch she planted in a corner near the house, and in a few\\ndays it had grown into a great tree', 'As for the Golden Water it\\nwas poured into a great marble basin specially prepared for it,\\nand it swelled and bubbled and then shot up into the air in a fountain\\ntwenty feet high', 'The fame of these wonders soon spread abroad, and people came\\nfrom far and near to see and admire', 'After a few days Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz fell back into\\ntheir ordinary way of life, and passed most of their time hunting', 'One day it happened that the Sultan of Persia was also hunting\\nin the same direction, and, not wishing to interfere with his sport,\\nthe young men, on hearing the noise of the hunt approaching,\\nprepared to retire, but, as luck would have it, they turned\\ninto the very path down which the Sultan was coming', 'They threw\\nthemselves from their horses and prostrated themselves to the earth,\\nbut the Sultan was curious to see their faces, and commanded them\\nto rise', 'The princes stood up respectfully, but quite at their ease,\\nand the Sultan looked at them for a few moments without speaking,\\nthen he asked who they were and where they lived', '\"Sire,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"we are sons of your Highness\\'s\\nlate intendant of the gardens, and we live in a house that he\\nbuilt a short time before his death, waiting till an occasion\\nshould offer itself to serve your Highness', '\"\\n\\n\"You seem fond of hunting,\" answered the Sultan', '\"Sire,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"it is our usual exercise,\\nand one that should be neglected by no man who expects to comply\\nwith the ancient customs of the kingdom and bear arms', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan was delighted with this remark, and said at once,\\n\"In that case I shall take great pleasure in watching you', 'Come, choose what sort of beasts you would like to hunt', '\"\\n\\nThe princes jumped on their horses and followed the Sultan\\nat a little distance', 'They had not gone very far before they\\nsaw a number of wild animals appear at once, and Prince Bahman\\nstarted to give chase to a lion and Prince Perviz to a bear', 'Both used their javelins with such skill that, directly they arrived\\nwithin striking range, the lion and the bear fell, pierced through\\nand through', 'Then Prince Perviz pursued a lion and Prince\\nBahman a bear, and in a very few minutes they, too, lay dead', 'As they were making ready for a third assault the Sultan interfered,\\nand, sending one of his officials to summon them, he said smiling,\\n\"If I let you go on, there will soon be no beasts left to hunt', 'Besides, your courage and manners have so won my heart that I will\\nnot have you expose yourselves to further danger', 'I am convinced\\nthat some day or other I shall find you useful as well a agreeable', '\"\\n\\nHe then gave them a warm invitation to stay with him altogether,\\nbut with many thanks for the honour done them, they begged to\\nbe excused, and to be suffered to remain at home', 'The Sultan who was not accustomed to see his offers rejected\\ninquired their reasons, and Prince Bahman explained that they did\\nnot wish to leave their sister, and were accustomed to do nothing\\nwithout consulting all three together', '\"Ask her advice, then,\" replied the Sultan, \"and to-morrow come\\nand hunt with me, and give me your answer', '\"\\n\\nThe two princes returned home, but their adventure made so little\\nimpression on them that they quite forgot to speak to their sister\\non the subject', 'The next morning when they went to hunt they met\\nthe Sultan in the same place, and he inquired what advice their\\nsister had given', 'The young men looked at each other and blushed', 'At last Prince Bahman said, \"Sire, we must throw ourselves on your\\nHighness\\'s mercy', 'Neither my brother nor myself remembered anything\\nabout it', '\"\\n\\n\"Then be sure you do not forget to-day,\" answered the Sultan,\\n\"and bring me back your reply to-morrow', '\"\\n\\nWhen, however, the same thing happened a second time, they feared\\nthat the Sultan might be angry with them for their carelessness', 'But he took it in good part, and, drawing three little golden\\nballs from his purse, he held them out to Prince Bahman, saying,\\n\"Put these in your bosom and you will not forget a third time,\\nfor when you remove your girdle to-night the noise they will make\\nin falling will remind you of my wishes', '\"\\n\\nIt all happened as the Sultan had foreseen, and the two brothers\\nappeared in their sister\\'s apartments just as she was in the act\\nof stepping into bed, and told their tale', 'The Princess Parizade was much disturbed at the news, and did not\\nconceal her feelings', '\"Your meeting with the Sultan is very honourable\\nto you,\" she said, \"and will, I dare say, be of service to you,\\nbut it places me in a very awkward position', \"It is on my account,\\nI know, that you have resisted the Sultan's wishes, and I am\\nvery grateful to you for it\", 'But kings do not like to have their\\noffers refused, and in time he would bear a grudge against you,\\nwhich would render me very unhappy', 'Consult the Talking Bird,\\nwho is wise and far-seeing, and let me hear what he says', '\"\\n\\nSo the bird was sent for and the case laid before him', '\"The princes must on no account refuse the Sultan\\'s proposal,\"\\nsaid he, \"and they must even invite him to come and see your house', '\"\\n\\n\"But, bird,\" objected the princess, \"you know how dearly we love\\neach other; will not all this spoil our friendship', '\"\\n\\n\"Not at all,\" replied the bird, \"it will make it all the closer', '\"\\n\\n\"Then the Sultan will have to see me,\" said the princess', 'The bird answered that it was necessary that he should see her,\\nand everything would turn out for the best', \"The following morning, when the Sultan inquired if they had spoken\\nto their sister and what advice she had given them, Prince Bahman\\nreplied that they were ready to agree to his Highness's wishes,\\nand that their sister had reproved them for their hesitation about\\nthe matter\", 'The Sultan received their excuses with great kindness,\\nand told them that he was sure they would be equally faithful to him,\\nand kept them by his side for the rest of the day, to the vexation\\nof the grand-vizir and the rest of the court', 'When the procession entered in this order the gates of the capital,\\nthe eyes of the people who crowded the streets were fixed on the two\\nyoung men, strangers to every one', '\"Oh, if only the Sultan had had sons like that', '\" they murmured,\\n\"they look so distinguished and are about the same age that his sons\\nwould have been', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan commanded that splendid apartments should be prepared for the\\ntwo brothers, and even insisted that they should sit at table with him', 'During dinner he led the conversation to various scientific subjects,\\nand also to history, of which he was especially fond, but whatever\\ntopic they might be discussing he found that the views of the young\\nmen were always worth listening to', '\"If they were my own sons,\"\\nhe said to himself, \"they could not be better educated', '\" and aloud\\nhe complimented them on their learning and taste for knowledge', 'At the end of the evening the princes once more prostrated themselves\\nbefore the throne and asked leave to return home; and then,\\nencouraged by the gracious words of farewell uttered by the Sultan,\\nPrince Bahman said:  \"Sire, may we dare to take the liberty of asking\\nwhether you would do us and our sister the honour of resting for\\na few minutes at our house the first time the hunt passes that way', '\"\\n\\n\"With the utmost pleasure,\" replied the Sultan; \"and as I am\\nall impatience to see the sister of such accomplished young men\\nyou may expect me the day after to-morrow', '\"\\n\\nThe princess was of course most anxious to entertain the Sultan\\nin a fitting way, but as she had no experience in court customs\\nshe ran to the Talking Bird, and begged he would advise her\\nas to what dishes should be served', '\"My dear mistress,\" replied the bird, \"your cooks are very good\\nand you can safely leave all to them, except that you must be\\ncareful to have a dish of cucumbers, stuffed with pearl sauce,\\nserved with the first course', '\"\\n\\n\"Cucumbers stuffed with pearls', '\" exclaimed the princess', '\"Why, bird,\\nwho ever heard of such a dish', 'The Sultan will expect a dinner he\\ncan eat, and not one he can only admire', 'Besides, if I were to use\\nall the pearls I possess, they would not be half enough', '\"\\n\\n\"Mistress,\" replied the bird, \"do what I tell you and nothing\\nbut good will come of it', 'And as to the pearls, if you go at dawn\\nto-morrow and dig at the foot of the first tree in the park,\\non the right hand, you will find as many as you want', '\"\\n\\nThe princess had faith in the bird, who generally proved to be right,\\nand taking the gardener with her early next morning followed out\\nhis directions carefully', 'After digging for some time they came\\nupon a golden box fastened with little clasps', 'These were easily undone, and the box was found to be full of pearls,\\nnot very large ones, but well-shaped and of a good colour', 'So leaving the gardener to fill up the hole he had made under the tree,\\nthe princess took up the box and returned to the house', 'The two princes had seen her go out, and had wondered what could have\\nmade her rise so early', 'Full of curiosity they got up and dressed,\\nand met their sister as she was returning with the box under her arm', '\"What have you been doing', '\" they asked, \"and did the gardener come\\nto tell you he had found a treasure', '\"\\n\\n\"On the contrary,\" replied the princess, \"it is I who have found one,\"\\nand opening the box she showed her astonished brothers the\\npearls inside', 'Then, on the way back to the palace, she told them\\nof her consultation with the bird, and the advice it had given her', 'All three tried to guess the meaning of the singular counsel,\\nbut they were forced at last to admit the explanation was beyond them,\\nand they must be content blindly to obey', 'The first thing the princess did on entering the palace was to send\\nfor the head cook and to order the repast for the Sultan When she\\nhad finished she suddenly added, \"Besides the dishes I have mentioned\\nthere is one that you must prepare expressly for the Sultan, and that\\nno one must touch but yourself', 'It consists of a stuffed cucumber,\\nand the stuffing is to be made of these pearls', '\"\\n\\nThe head cook, who had never in all his experience heard of such\\na dish, stepped back in amazement', '\"You think I am mad,\" answered the princess, who perceived what was\\nin his mind', '\"But I know quite well what I am doing', 'Go, and do\\nyour best, and take the pearls with you', '\"\\n\\nThe next morning the princes started for the forest, and were soon\\njoined by the Sultan', 'The hunt began and continued till mid-day,\\nwhen the heat became so great that they were obliged to leave off', \"Then, as arranged, they turned their horses' heads towards the palace,\\nand while Prince Bahman remained by the side of the Sultan,\\nPrince Perviz rode on to warn his sister of their approach\", 'The moment his Highness entered the courtyard, the princess flung\\nherself at his feet, but he bent and raised her, and gazed at her\\nfor some time, struck with her grace and beauty, and also with the\\nindefinable air of courts that seemed to hang round this country girl', '\"They are all worthy one of the other,\" he said to himself,\\n\"and I am not surprised that they think so much of her opinions', 'I must know more of them', '\"\\n\\nBy this time the princess had recovered from the first embarrassment\\nof meeting, and proceeded to make her speech of welcome', '\"This is only a simple country house, sire,\" she said,\\n\"suitable to people like ourselves, who live a quiet life', \"It cannot compare with the great city mansions, much less,\\nof course, with the smallest of the Sultan's palaces\", '\"\\n\\n\"I cannot quite agree with you,\" he replied; \"even the little\\nthat I have seen I admire greatly, and I will reserve my judgment\\nuntil you have shown me the whole', '\"\\n\\nThe princess then led the way from room to room, and the Sultan examined\\neverything carefully', '\"Do you call this a simple country house', '\"\\nhe said at last', '\"Why, if every country house was like this,\\nthe towns would soon be deserted', 'I am no longer astonished\\nthat you do not wish to leave it', 'Let us go into the gardens,\\nwhich I am sure are no less beautiful than the rooms', '\"\\n\\nA small door opened straight into the garden, and the first object\\nthat met the Sultan\\'s eyes was the Golden Water', '\"What lovely coloured water', '\" he exclaimed; \"where is the spring,\\nand how do you make the fountain rise so high', 'I do not believe there\\nis anything like it in the world', '\"  He went forward to examine it,\\nand when he had satisfied his curiosity, the princess conducted him\\ntowards the Singing Tree', 'As they drew near, the Sultan was startled by the sound of\\nstrange voices, but could see nothing', '\"Where have you hidden\\nyour musicians', '\" he asked the princess; \"are they up in the air,\\nor under the earth', 'Surely the owners of such charming voices\\nought not to conceal themselves', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" answered the princess, \"the voices all come from the tree\\nwhich is straight in front of us; and if you will deign to advance\\na few steps, you will see that they become clearer', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan did as he was told, and was so wrapt in delight\\nat what he heard that he stood some time in silence', '\"Tell me, madam, I pray you,\" he said at last, \"how this\\nmarvellous tree came into your garden', 'It must have been brought\\nfrom a great distance, or else, fond as I am of all curiosities,\\nI could not have missed hearing of it', 'What is its name', '\"\\n\\n\"The only name it has, sire,\" replied she, \"is the Singing Tree,\\nand it is not a native of this country', 'Its history is mixed up with\\nthose of the Golden Water and the Talking Bird, which you have not\\nyet seen', 'If your Highness wishes I will tell you the whole story,\\nwhen you have recovered from your fatigue', '\"\\n\\n\"Indeed, madam,\" returned he, \"you show me so many wonders that it\\nis impossible to feel any fatigue', 'Let us go once more and look\\nat the Golden Water; and I am dying to see the Talking Bird', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan could hardly tear himself away from the Golden Water,\\nwhich puzzled him more and more', '\"You say,\" he observed to\\nthe princess, \"that this water does not come from any spring,\\nneither is brought by pipes', 'All I understand is, that neither\\nit nor the Singing Tree is a native of this country', '\"\\n\\n\"It is as you say, sire,\" answered the princess, \"and if you\\nexamine the basin, you will see that it is all in one piece,\\nand therefore the water could not have been brought through it', 'What is more astonishing is, that I only emptied a small flaskful\\ninto the basin, and it increased to the quantity you now see', '\"\\n\\n\"Well, I will look at it no more to-day,\" said the Sultan', '\"Take me to the Talking Bird', '\"\\n\\nOn approaching the house, the Sultan noticed a vast quantity of birds,\\nwhose voices filled the air, and he inquired why they were so much\\nmore numerous here than in any other part of the garden', '\"Sire,\" answered the princess, \"do you see that cage hanging in one\\nof the windows of the saloon', 'that is the Talking Bird, whose voice\\nyou can hear above them all, even above that of the nightingale', 'And the birds crowd to this spot, to add their songs to his', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan stepped through the window, but the bird took no notice,\\ncontinuing his song as before', '\"My slave,\" said the princess, \"this is the Sultan; make him\\na pretty speech', '\"\\n\\nThe bird stopped singing at once, and all the other birds stopped too', '\"The Sultan is welcome,\" he said', '\"I wish him long life\\nand all prosperity', '\"\\n\\n\"I thank you, good bird,\" answered the Sultan, seating himself\\nbefore the repast, which was spread at a table near the window,\\n\"and I am enchanted to see in you the Sultan and King of the Birds', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan, noticing that his favourite dish of cucumber was placed\\nbefore him, proceeded to help himself to it, and was amazed to and\\nthat the stuffing was of pearls', '\"A novelty, indeed', '\" cried he,\\n\"but I do not understand the reason of it; one cannot eat pearls', '\"\\n\\n\"Sire,\" replied the bird, before either the princes or the princess\\ncould speak, \"surely your Highness cannot be so surprised at beholding\\na cucumber stuffed with pearls, when you believed without any\\ndifficulty that the Sultana had presented you, instead of children,\\nwith a dog, a cat, and a log of wood', '\"\\n\\n\"I believed it,\" answered the Sultan, \"because the women attending\\non her told me so', '\"\\n\\n\"The women, sire,\" said the bird, \"were the sisters of the Sultana,\\nwho were devoured with jealousy at the honour you had done her, and in\\norder to revenge themselves invented this story', 'Have them examined,\\nand they will confess their crime', 'These are your children,\\nwho were saved from death by the intendant of your gardens,\\nand brought up by him as if they were his own', '\"\\n\\nLike a flash the truth came to the mind of the Sultan', '\"Bird,\" he cried, \"my heart tells me that what you say is true', 'My children,\" he added, \"let me embrace you, and embrace each other,\\nnot only as brothers and sister, but as having in you the blood\\nroyal of Persia which could flow in no nobler veins', '\"\\n\\nWhen the first moments of emotion were over, the Sultan hastened\\nto finish his repast, and then turning to his children he exclaimed: \\n\"To-day you have made acquaintance with your father', 'To-morrow I\\nwill bring you the Sultana your mother', 'Be ready to receive her', '\"\\n\\nThe Sultan then mounted his horse and rode quickly back to the capital', \"Without an instant's delay he sent for the grand-vizir, and ordered\\nhim to seize and question the Sultana's sisters that very day\", 'This was done', 'They were confronted with each other and proved guilty,\\nand were executed in less than an hour', 'But the Sultan did not wait to hear that his orders had been\\ncarried out before going on foot, followed by his whole court to\\nthe door of the great mosque, and drawing the Sultana with his own\\nhand out of the narrow prison where she had spent so many

LITTLE PRINCE', 'Once when I was six years old I saw a magnificent picture in a book, called True Stories from Nature, about the primeval forest', 'It was a picture of a boa constrictor in the act of swallowing an animal', 'Here is a copy of the drawing', 'In the book it said: \"Boa constrictors swallow their prey whole, without chewing it', 'After that they are not able to move, and they sleep through the six months that they need for digestion', '\" I pondered deeply, then, over the adventures of the jungle', 'And after some work with a colored pencil I succeeded in making my first drawing', 'My Drawing Number One', 'It looked like this', 'I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them', 'But they answered: \"Frighten', 'Why should anyone be frightened by a hat', '\" My drawing was not a picture of a hat', 'It was a picture of a boa constrictor digesting an elephant', 'But since the grown-ups were not able to understand it, I made another drawing: I drew the inside of the boa constrictor, so that the grown-ups could see it clearly', 'They always need to have things explained', 'My Drawing Number Two looked like this', \"The grown-ups' response, this time, was to advise me to lay aside my drawings of boa constrictors, whether from the inside or the outside, and devote myself instead to geography, history, arithmetic and grammar\", 'That is why, at the age of six, I gave up what might have been a magnificent career as a painter', 'I had been disheartened by the failure of my Drawing Number One and my Drawing Number Two', 'Grown-ups never understand anything by themselves, and it is tiresome for children to be always and forever explaining things to them', 'So then I chose another profession, and learned to pilot airplanes', 'I have flown a little over all parts of the world; and it is true that geography has been very useful to me', 'At a glance I can distinguish China from Arizona', 'If one gets lost in the night, such knowledge is valuable', 'In the course of this life I have had a great many encounters with a great many people who have been concerned with matters of consequence', 'I have lived a great deal among grown-ups', 'I have seen them intimately, close at hand', \"And that hasn't much improved my opinion of them\", 'Whenever I met one of them who seemed to me at all clear-sighted, I tried the experiment of showing him my Drawing Number One, which I have always kept', 'I would try to find out, so, if this was a person of true understanding', 'But, whoever it was, he, or she, would always say: \"That is a hat', '\" Then I would never talk to that person about boa constrictors, or primeval forests, or stars', 'I would bring myself down to his level', 'I would talk to him about bridge, and golf, and politics, and neckties', 'And the grown-up would be greatly pleased to have met such a sensible man', 'So I lived my life alone, without anyone that I could really talk to, until I had an accident with my plane in the Desert of Sahara, six years ago', 'Something was broken in my engine', 'And as I had with me neither a mechanic nor any passengers, I set myself to attempt the difficult repairs all alone', 'It was a question of life or death for me: I had scarcely enough drinking water to last a week', 'The first night, then, I went to sleep on the sand, a thousand miles from any human habitation', 'I was more isolated than a shipwrecked sailor on a raft in the middle of the ocean', 'Thus you can imagine my amazement, at sunrise, when I was awakened by an odd little voice', 'It said: \"If you please, draw me a sheep', '\"\"What', '\"\"Draw me a sheep', '\"I jumped to my feet, completely thunderstruck', 'I blinked my eyes hard', 'I looked carefully all around me', 'And I saw a most extraordinary small person, who stood there examining me with great seriousness', 'Here you may see the best portrait that, later, I was able to make of him', 'But my drawing is certainly very much less charming than its model', 'That, however, is not my fault', \"The grown-ups discouraged me in my painter's career when I was six years old, and I never learned to draw anything, except boas from the outside and boas from the inside\", 'Now I stared at this sudden apparition with my eyes fairly starting out of my head in astonishment', 'Remember, I had crashed in the desert a thousand miles from any inhabited region', 'And yet my little man seemed neither to be straying uncertainly among the sands, nor to be fainting from fatigue or hunger or thirst or fear', 'Nothing about him gave any suggestion of a child lost in the middle of the desert, a thousand miles from any human habitation', 'When at last I was able to speak, I said to him: \"But, what are you doing here', '\" And in answer he repeated, very slowly, as if he were speaking of a matter of great consequence:\"If you please, draw me a sheep', '\"When a mystery is too overpowering, one dare not disobey', 'Absurd as it might seem to me, a thousand miles from any human habitation and in danger of death, I took out of my pocket a sheet of paper and my fountain-pen', 'But then I remembered how my studies had been concentrated on geography, history, arithmetic, and grammar, and I told the little chap (a little crossly, too) that I did not know how to draw', 'He answered me: \"That doesn\\'t matter', 'Draw me a sheep', '\" But I had never drawn a sheep', 'So I drew for him one of the two pictures I had drawn so often', 'It was that of the boa constrictor from the outside', 'And I was astounded to hear the little fellow greet it with, \"No, no, no', 'I do not want an elephant inside a boa constrictor', 'A boa constrictor is a very dangerous creature, and an elephant is very cumbersome', 'Where I live, everything is very small', 'What I need is a sheep', 'Draw me a sheep', 'So then I made a drawing', 'He looked at it carefully, and then he said: \"No', 'This sheep is already very sickly', 'Make me another', '\" So I made another drawing', 'My friend smiled gently and indulgently', '\"You see yourself,\" he said, \"that this is not a sheep', 'This is a ram', 'It has horns', 'So then I did my drawing over once more', 'But it was rejected too, just like the others', '\"This one is too old', 'I want a sheep that will live a long time', 'By this time my patience was exhausted, because I was in a hurry to start taking my engine apart', 'So I tossed off this drawing', 'And I threw out an explanation with it', '\"This is only his box', 'The sheep you asked for is inside', '\"I was very surprised to see a light break over the face of my young judge:\"That is exactly the way I wanted it', 'Do you think that this sheep will have to have a great deal of grass', '\"\"Why', '\"\"Because where I live everything is very small', '\"\"There will surely be enough grass for him,\" I said', '\"It is a very small sheep that I have given you', '\"He bent his head over the drawing: \"Not so small that, Look', 'He has gone to sleep', '\"\\xa0And that is how I made the acquaintance of the little prince', 'It took me a long time to learn where he came from', 'The little prince, who asked me so many questions, never seemed to hear the ones I asked him', 'It was from words dropped by chance that, little by little, everything was revealed to me', 'The first time he saw my airplane, for instance (I shall not draw my airplane; that would be much too complicated for me), and he asked me: \"What is that object', '\"\"That is not an object', 'It flies', 'It is an airplane', 'It is my airplane', '\" And I was proud to have him learn that I could fly', 'He cried out, then: \"What', 'You dropped down from the sky', '\"\"Yes,\" I answered, modestly', '\"Oh', 'That is funny', '\" And the little prince broke into a lovely peal of laughter, which irritated me very much', 'I like my misfortunes to be taken seriously', 'Then he added: \"So you, too, come from the sky', 'Which is your planet', '\" At that moment I caught a gleam of light in the impenetrable mystery of his presence; and I demanded, abruptly: \"Do you come from another planet', '\" But he did not reply', 'He tossed his head gently, without taking his eyes from my plane: \"It is true that on that you can\\'t have come from very far away', '\" And he sank into a reverie, which lasted a long time', 'Then, taking my sheep out of his pocket, he buried himself in the contemplation of his treasure', 'You can imagine how my curiosity was aroused by this half-confidence about the \"other planets', '\" I made a great effort, therefore, to find out more on this subject', '\"My little man, where do you come from', \"What is this 'where I live,' of which you speak\", 'Where do you want to take your sheep', '\"After a reflective silence he answered: \"The thing that is so good about the box you have given me is that at night he can use it as his house', '\"\"That is so', 'And if you are good I will give you a string, too, so that you can tie him during the day, and a post to tie him to', '\"But the little prince seemed shocked by this offer: \"Tie him', 'What a queer idea', '\"\"But if you don\\'t tie him,\" I said, \"he will wander off somewhere, and get lost', '\"My friend broke into another peal of laughter: \"But where do you think he would go', '\" \"Anywhere', 'Straight ahead of him', '\"Then the little prince said, earnestly: \"That doesn\\'t matter', 'Where I live, everything is so small', '\" And, with perhaps a hint of sadness, he added: \"Straight ahead of him, nobody can go very far', '\"I had thus learned a second fact of great importance: this was that the planet the little prince came from was scarcely any larger than a house', 'But that did not really surprise me much', 'I knew very well that in addition to the great planets, such as the Earth, Jupiter, Mars, Venus, to which we have given names, there are also hundreds of others, some of which are so small that one has a hard time seeing them through the telescope', 'When an astronomer discovers one of these he does not give it a name, but only a number', 'He might call it, for example, \"Asteroid 325', '\"I have serious reason to believe that the planet from which the little prince came is the asteroid known as B-612', 'This asteroid has only once been seen through the telescope', 'That was by a Turkish astronomer, in 1909', 'On making his discovery, the astronomer had presented it to the International Astronomical Congress, in a great demonstration', 'But he was in Turkish costume, and so nobody would believe what he said', 'Grown-ups are like that', 'Fortunately, however, for the reputation of Asteroid B-612, a Turkish dictator made a law that his subjects, under pain of death, should change to European costume', 'So in 1920 the astronomer gave his demonstration all over again, dressed with impressive style and elegance', 'And this time everybody accepted his report', 'If I have told you these details about the asteroid, and made a note of its number for you, it is on account of the grown-ups and their ways', 'When you tell them that you have made a new friend, they never ask you any questions about essential matters', 'They never say to you, \"What does his voice sound like', 'What games does he love best', 'Does he collect butterflies', '\" Instead, they demand: \"How old is he', 'How many brothers has he got', 'How much does he weigh', 'How much money does his father make', '\"Only from these figures do they think they have learned anything about him', 'If you were to say to the grown-ups: \"I saw a beautiful house made of rosy brick, with geraniums in the windows and doves on the roof,\" they would not be able to get any idea of that house at all', 'You would have to say to them: \"I saw a house that cost $ 20,000', '\" Then they would exclaim: \"Oh, what a pretty house that is', '\" Just so, you might say to them: \"The proof that the little prince existed is that he was charming, that he laughed, and that he was looking for a sheep', 'If anybody wants a sheep, that is a proof that he exists', '\" And what good would it do to tell them that', 'They would shrug their shoulders, and treat you like a child', 'But if you said to them: \"The planet he came from is Asteroid B-612,\" then they would be convinced, and leave you in peace from their questions', 'They are like that', 'One must not hold it against them', 'Children should always show great forbearance toward grown-up people', 'But certainly, for us who understand life, figures are a matter of indifference', 'I should have liked to begin this story in the fashion of the fairy-tales', 'I should have like to say: \"Once upon a time there was a little prince who lived on a planet that was scarcely any bigger than him, and who had need of a sheep', '\"To those who understand life, that would have given a much greater air of truth to my story', 'For I do not want anyone to read my book carelessly', 'I have suffered too much grief in setting down these memories', 'Six years have already passed since my friend went away from me, with his sheep', 'If I try to describe him here, it is to make sure that I shall not forget him', 'To forget a friend is sad', 'Not everyone has had a friend', 'And if I forget him, I may become like the grown-ups who are no longer interested in anything but figures', 'It is for that purpose, again, that I have bought a box of paints and some pencils', 'It is hard to take up drawing again at my age, when I have never made any pictures except those of the boa constrictor from the outside and the boa constrictor from the inside, since I was six', 'I shall certainly try to make my portraits as true to life as possible', 'But I am not at all sure of success', 'One drawing goes along all right, and another has no resemblance to its subject', \"I make some errors, too, in the little prince's height: in one place he is too tall and in another too short\", 'And I feel some doubts about the color of his costume', 'So I fumble along as best I can, now good, now bad, and I hope generally fair-to-middling', 'In certain more important details I shall make mistakes, also', 'But that is something that will not be my fault', 'My friend never explained anything to me', 'He thought, perhaps, that I was like him', 'But I, alas, do not know how to see sheep through the walls of boxes', 'Perhaps I am a little like the grown-ups', 'I have had to grow old', \"As each day passed I would learn, in our talk, something about the little prince's planet, his departure from it, and his journey\", 'The information would come very slowly, as it might chance to fall from his thoughts', 'It was in this way that I heard, on the third day, about the catastrophe of the baobabs', 'This time, once more, I had the sheep to thank for it', 'For the little prince asked me abruptly, as if seized by a grave doubt,\"It is true, isn\\'t it, that sheep eat little bushes', '\"\"Yes, that is true', '\"\"Ah', 'I am glad', '\"I did not understand why it was so important that sheep should eat little bushes', 'But the little prince added: \"Then it follows that they also eat baobabs', '\" I pointed out to the little prince that baobabs were not little bushes, but, on the contrary, trees as big as castles; and that even if he took a whole herd of elephants away with him, the herd would not eat up one single baobab', 'The idea of the herd of elephants made the little prince laugh', '\"We would have to put them one on top of the other,\" he said', 'But he made a wise comment:\"Before they grow so big, the baobabs start out by being little', '\"\"That is strictly correct,\" I said', '\"But why do you want the sheep to eat the little baobabs', '\"He answered me at once, \"Oh, come, come', '\", as if he were speaking of something that was self-evident', 'And I was obliged to make a great mental effort to solve this problem, without any assistance', 'Indeed, as I learned, there were on the planet where the little prince lived, as on all planets, good plants and bad plants', 'In consequence, there were good seeds from good plants, and bad seeds from bad plants', 'But seeds are invisible', \"They sleep deep in the heart of the earth's darkness, until someone among them is seized with the desire to awaken\", 'Then this little seed will stretch itself and begin, timidly at first, to push a charming little sprig inoffensively upward toward the sun', 'If it is only a sprout of radish or the sprig of a rose-bush, one would let it grow wherever it might wish', 'But when it is a bad plant, one must destroy it as soon as possible, the very first instant that one recognizes it', 'Now there were some terrible seeds on the planet that was the home of the little prince; and these were the seeds of the baobab', 'The soil of that planet was infested with them', 'A baobab is something you will never, never be able to get rid of if you attend to it too late', 'It spreads over the entire planet', 'It bores clear through it with its roots', 'And if the planet is too small, and the baobabs are too many, they split it in pieces', '\"It is a question of discipline,\" the little prince said to me later on', '\"When you\\'ve finished your own toilet in the morning, then it is time to attend to the toilet of your planet, just so, with the greatest care', 'You must see to it that you pull up regularly all the baobabs, at the very first moment when they can be distinguished from the rosebushes which they resemble so closely in their earliest youth', 'It is very tedious work,\" the little prince added, \"but very easy', '\" And one day he said to me: \"You ought to make a beautiful drawing, so that the children where you live can see exactly how all this is', 'That would be very useful to them if they were to travel some day', 'Sometimes,\" he added, \"there is no harm in putting off a piece of work until another day', 'But when it is a matter of baobabs, it always means a catastrophe', 'I knew a planet that was inhabited by a lazy man', 'He neglected three little bushes', 'So, as the little prince described it to me, I have made a drawing of that planet', 'I do not much like to take the tone of a moralist', 'But the danger of the baobabs is so little understood, and such considerable risks would be run by anyone who might get lost on an asteroid, that for once I am breaking through my reserve', '\"Children,\" I say plainly, \"watch out for the baobabs', '\" My friends, like myself, have been skirting this danger for a long time, without ever knowing it; and so it is for them that I have worked so hard over this drawing', 'The lesson which I pass on by this means is worth all the trouble it has cost me', 'Perhaps you will ask me, \"Why are there no other drawings in this book as magnificent and impressive as this drawing of the baobabs', '\" The reply is simple', 'I have tried', 'But with the others I have not been successful', 'When I made the drawing of the baobabs I was carried beyond myself by the inspiring force of urgent necessity', 'Oh, little prince', 'Bit by bit I came to understand the secrets of your sad little life', 'For a long time you had found your only entertainment in the quiet pleasure of looking at the sunset', 'I learned that new detail on the morning of the fourth day, when you said to me:\"I am very fond of sunsets', 'Come, let us go look at a sunset now', '\"\"But we must wait,\" I said', '\"Wait', 'What for', '\"\"For the sunset', 'We must wait until it is time', '\"At first you seemed to be very much surprised', 'And then you laughed to yourself', 'You said to me: \"I am always thinking that I am at home', '\"Just so', 'Everybody knows that when it is noon in the United States the sun is setting over France', 'If you could fly to France in one minute, you could go straight into the sunset, right from noon', 'Unfortunately, France is too far away for that', 'But on your tiny planet, my little prince, all you need do is move your chair a few steps', 'You can see the day end and the twilight falling whenever you like', '\"One day,\" you said to me, \"I saw the sunset forty-four times', '\"And a little later you added: \"You know, one loves the sunset, when one is so sad', '\" \"Were you so sad, then', '\" I asked, \"On the day of the forty-four sunsets', '\"But the little prince made no reply', \"On the fifth day, again, as always, it was thanks to the sheep, the secret of the little prince's life was revealed to me\", 'Abruptly, without anything to lead up to it, and as if the question had been born of long and silent meditation on his problem, he demanded: \"A sheep; if it eats little bushes, does it eat flowers, too', '\"\"A sheep,\" I answered, \"eats anything it finds in its reach', '\"\"Even flowers that have thorns', '\"\"Yes, even flowers that have thorns', '\"\"Then the thorns, what use are they', '\" I did not know', 'At that moment I was very busy trying to unscrew a bolt that had got stuck in my engine', 'I was very much worried, for it was becoming clear to me that the breakdown of my plane was extremely serious', 'And I had so little drinking-water left that I had to fear for the worst', '\"The thorns, what use are they', '\"The little prince never let go of a question, once he had asked it', 'As for me, I was upset over that bolt', 'And I answered with the first thing that came into my head: \"The thorns are of no use at all', 'Flowers have thorns just for spite', '\"\"Oh', '\" There was a moment of complete silence', 'Then the little prince flashed back at me, with a kind of resentfulness: \"I don\\'t believe you', 'Flowers are weak creatures', 'They are naïve', 'They reassure themselves as best they can', 'They believe that their thorns are terrible weapons', '\"I did not answer', 'At that instant I was saying to myself: \"If this bolt still won\\'t turn, I am going to knock it out with the hammer', '\"Again the little prince disturbed my thoughts', '\"And you actually believe that the flowers', '\"\"Oh no', '\" I cried', '\"No no no', \"I don't believe anything\", 'I answered you with the first thing that came into my head', \"Don't you see, I am very busy with matters of consequence\", '\"He stared at me, thunderstruck', '\"Matters of consequence', '\"He looked at me there, with my hammer in my hand, my fingers black with engine grease, bending down over an object which seemed to him extremely ugly', '\"You talk just like the grown-ups', '\" That made me a little ashamed', 'But he went on, relentlessly: \"You mix everything up together', 'You confuse everything', '\"He was really very angry', 'He tossed his golden curls in the breeze', '\"I know a planet where there is a certain red-faced gentleman', 'He has never smelled a flower', 'He has never looked at a star', 'He has never loved any one', 'He has never done anything in his life but add up figures', \"And all day he says over and over, just like you: 'I am busy with matters of consequence\", \"' And that makes him swell up with pride\", '\"But he is not a man, he is a mushroom', '\"\"A what', '\"\"A mushroom', '\" The little prince was now white with rage', '\"The flowers have been growing thorns for millions of years', 'For millions of years the sheep have been eating them just the same', 'And is it not a matter of consequence to try to understand why the flowers go to so much trouble to grow thorns which are never of any use to them', 'Is the warfare between the sheep and the flowers not important', \"Is this not of more consequence than a fat red-faced gentleman's sums\", 'And if I know, I, myself, one flower which is unique in the world, which grows nowhere but on my planet, but which one little sheep can destroy in a single bite some morning, without even noticing what he is doing, Oh', 'You think that is not important', '\"His face turned from white to red as he continued: \"If someone loves a flower, of which just one single blossom grows in all the millions and millions of stars, it is enough to make him happy just to look at the stars', \"\\x94He can say to himself, 'Somewhere, my flower is there\", \"' But if the sheep eats the flower, in one moment all his stars will be darkened\", 'And you think that is not important', '\"He could not say anything more', 'His words were choked by sobbing', 'The night had fallen', 'I had let my tools drop from my hands', 'Of what moment now was my hammer, my bolt, or thirst, or death', 'On one star, one planet, my planet, the Earth, there was a little prince to be comforted', 'I took him in my arms, and rocked him', 'I said to him: \"The flower that you love is not in danger', 'I will draw you a muzzle for your sheep', 'I will draw you a railing to put around your flower', 'I will', '\"I did not know what to say to him', 'I felt awkward and blundering', 'I did not know how I could reach him, where I could overtake him and go on hand in hand with him once more', 'It is such a secret place, the land of tears', 'I soon learned to know this flower better', \"On the little prince's planet the flowers had always been very simple\", 'They had only one ring of petals; they took up no room at all; they were a trouble to nobody', 'One morning they would appear in the grass, and by night they would have faded peacefully away', 'But one day, from a seed blown from no one knew where, a new flower had come up; and the little prince had watched very closely over this small sprout which was not like any other small sprouts on his planet', 'It might, you see, have been a new kind of baobab', 'The shrub soon stopped growing, and began to get ready to produce a flower', 'The little prince, who was present at the first appearance of a huge bud, felt at once that some sort of miraculous apparition must emerge from it', 'But the flower was not satisfied to complete the preparations for her beauty in the shelter of her green chamber', 'She chose her colours with the greatest care', 'She adjusted her petals one by one', 'She did not wish to go out into the world all rumpled, like the field poppies', 'It was only in the full radiance of her beauty that she wished to appear', 'Oh, yes', 'She was a coquettish creature', 'And her mysterious adornment lasted for days and days', 'Then one morning, exactly at sunrise, she suddenly showed herself', 'And, after working with all this painstaking precision, she yawned and said: \"Ah', 'I am scarcely awake', 'I beg that you will excuse me', 'My petals are still all disarranged', '\" But the little prince could not restrain his admiration:\"Oh', 'How beautiful you are', '\"\"Am I not', '\" the flower responded, sweetly', '\"And I was born at the same moment as the sun', '\"The little prince could guess easily enough that she was not any too modest, but how moving, and exciting she was', '\"I think it is time for breakfast,\" she added an instant later', '\"If you would have the kindness to think of my needs\" And the little prince, completely abashed, went to look for a sprinkling can of fresh water', 'So, he tended the flower', 'So, too, she began very quickly to torment him with her vanity, which was, if the truth be known, a little difficult to deal with', 'One day, for instance, when she was speaking of her four thorns, she said to the little prince: \"Let the tigers come with their claws', '\"\"There are no tigers on my planet,\" the little prince objected', '\"And, anyway, tigers do not eat weeds', '\"\"I am not a weed,\" the flower replied, sweetly', '\"Please excuse me', '\" \"I am not at all afraid of tigers,\" she went on, \"but I am afraid of drafts', 'I suppose you wouldn\\'t have a screen for me\"\"Afraid of drafts, that is bad luck for a plant,\" remarked the little prince, and added to himself, \"This flower is a very complex creature', '\"\"At night I want you to put me under a glass globe', 'It is very cold where you live', 'In the place I came from', '\" But she interrupted herself at that point', 'She had come in the form of a seed', 'She could not have known anything of any other worlds', 'Embarrassed over having let herself be caught on the verge of such an untruth, she coughed two or three times, in order to put the little prince in the wrong', '\"The screen', '\"\"I was just going to look for it when you spoke to me', '\"Then she forced her cough a little more so that he should suffer from remorse just the same', 'So the little prince, in spite of all the good will that was inseparable from his love, had soon come to doubt her', 'He had taken seriously words which were without importance, and it made him very unhappy', '\"I ought not to have listened to her,\" he confided to me one day', '\"One never ought to listen to the flowers', 'One should simply look at them and breathe their fragrance', 'Mine perfumed my entire planet', 'But I did not know how to take pleasure in all her grace', 'This tale of claws, which disturbed me so much, should only have filled my heart with tenderness and pity', '\"And he continued his confidences: \"The fact is that I did not know how to understand anything', 'I ought to have judged by deeds and not by words', 'She cast her fragrance and her radiance over me', 'I ought never to have run away from her', 'I ought to have guessed all the affection that lay behind her poor little stratagems', 'Flowers are so inconsistent', 'But I was too young to know how to love her', '\"I believe that for his escape he took advantage of the migration of a flock of wild birds', 'On the morning of his departure he put his planet in perfect order', 'He carefully cleaned out his active volcanoes', 'He possessed two active volcanoes; and they were very convenient for heating his breakfast in the morning', 'He also had one volcano that was extinct', 'But, as he said, \"One never knows', '\" So he cleaned out the extinct volcano, too', 'If they are well cleaned out, volcanoes burn slowly and steadily, without any eruptions', 'Volcanic eruptions are like fires in a chimney', 'On our earth we are obviously much too small to clean out our volcanoes', 'That is why they bring no end of trouble upon us', 'The little prince also pulled up, with a certain sense of dejection, the last little shoots of the baobabs', 'He believed that he would never want to return', 'But on this last morning all these familiar tasks seemed very precious to him', 'And when he watered the flower for the last time, and prepared to place her under the shelter of her glass globe, he realized that he was very close to tears', '\"Goodbye,\" he said to the flower', 'But she made no answer', '\"Goodbye,\" he said again', 'The flower coughed', 'But it was not because she had a cold', '\"I have been silly,\" she said to him, at last', '\"I ask your forgiveness', 'Try to be happy', '\" He was surprised by this absence of reproaches', 'He stood there all bewildered, the glass globe held arrested in mid-air', 'He did not understand this quiet sweetness', '\"Of course I love you,\" the flower said to him', '\"It is my fault that you have not known it all the while', 'That is of no importance', 'But you, you have been just as foolish as I', 'Try to be happy', 'let the glass globe be', \"I don't want it anymore\", '\"\"But the wind', '\" \"My cold is not so bad as all that', 'the cool night air will do me good', 'I am a flower', '\"\"But the animals', '\" \"Well, I must endure the presence of two or three caterpillars if I wish to become acquainted with the butterflies', 'It seems that they are very beautiful', 'And if not the butterflies and the caterpillars who will call upon me', 'You will be far away', 'as for the large animals, I am not at all afraid of any of them', 'I have my claws', '\"And, naively, she showed her four thorns', 'Then she added: \"Don\\'t linger like this', 'You have decided to go away', 'Now go', '\"For she did not want him to see her crying', 'She was such a proud flower', 'He found himself in the neighborhood of the asteroids 325, 326, 327, 328, 329, and 330', 'He began, therefore, by visiting them, in order to add to his knowledge', 'The first of them was inhabited by a king', 'Clad in royal purple and ermine, he was seated upon a throne which was at the same time both simple and majestic', '\"Ah', 'Here is a subject,\" exclaimed the king, when he saw the little prince coming', 'And the little prince asked himself: \"How could he recognize me when he had never seen me before', '\"He did not know how the world is simplified for kings', 'To them, all men are subjects', '\"Approach, so that I may see you better,\" said the king, who felt proud of being at last a king over somebody', \"The little prince looked everywhere to find a place to sit down; but the entire planet was crammed and obstructed by the king's magnificent ermine robe\", 'So he remained standing upright, and, since he was tired, he yawned', '\"It is contrary to etiquette to yawn in the presence of a king,\" the monarch said to him', '\"I forbid you to do so', '\"\"I can\\'t help it', 'I can\\'t stop myself,\" replied the little prince, thoroughly embarrassed', '\"I have come on a long journey, and I have had no sleep', '\"\"Ah, then,\" the king said', '\"I order you to yawn', 'It is years since I have seen anyone yawning', 'Yawns, to me, are objects of curiosity', 'Come, now', 'Yawn again', 'It is an order', '\"\"That frightens me', 'I cannot, anymore', '\" murmured the little prince, now completely abashed', '\"Hum', 'Hum', '\" replied the king', '\"Then I', 'I order you sometimes to yawn and sometimes too\" He sputtered a little, and seemed vexed', 'For what the king fundamentally insisted upon was that his authority should be respected', 'He tolerated no disobedience', 'He was an absolute monarch', 'But, because he was a very good man, he made his orders reasonable', '\"If I ordered a general,\" he would say, by way of example, \"if I ordered a general to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not obey me that would not be the fault of the general', 'It would be my fault', '\"\"May I sit down', '\" came now a timid inquiry from the little prince', '\"I order you to do so,\" the king answered him, and majestically gathered in a fold of his ermine mantle', 'But the little prince was wondering', 'The planet was tiny', 'Over what could this king really rule', '\"Sire,\" he said to him, \"I beg that you will excuse my asking you a question\"\"I order you to ask me a question,\" the king hastened to assure him', '\"Sire, over what do you rule', '\" \"Over everything,\" said the king, with magnificent simplicity', '\"Over everything', '\" The king made a gesture, which took in his planet, the other planets, and all the stars', '\"Over all that', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Over all that,\" the king answered', 'For his rule was not only absolute: it was also universal', '\"And the stars obey you', '\" \"Certainly they do,\" the king said', '\"They obey instantly', 'I do not permit insubordination', '\"Such power was a thing for the little prince to marvel at', 'If he had been master of such complete authority, he would have been able to watch the sunset, not forty-four times in one day, but seventy-two, or even a hundred, or even two hundred times, without ever having to move his chair', 'And because he felt a bit sad as he remembered his little planet which he had forsaken, he plucked up his courage to ask the king a favor:\"I should like to see a sunset', 'do me that kindness', 'Order the sun to set', '\"\"If I ordered a general to fly from one flower to another like a butterfly, or to write a tragic drama, or to change himself into a sea bird, and if the general did not carry out the order that he had received, which one of us would be in the wrong', '\" the king demanded', '\"The general or myself', '\"\"You,\" said the little prince firmly', '\"Exactly', 'One much requires from each one the duty which each one can perform,\" the king went on', '\"Accepted authority rests first of all on reason', 'If you ordered your people to go and throw themselves into the sea, they would rise up in revolution', 'I have the right to require obedience because my orders are reasonable', '\"\"Then my sunset', '\" the little prince reminded him: for he never forgot a question once he had asked it', '\"You shall have your sunset', 'I shall command it', 'But, according to my science of government, I shall wait until conditions are favorable', '\"\"When will that be', '\" inquired the little prince', '\"Hum', 'Hum', '\" replied the king; and before saying anything else he consulted a bulky almanac', '\"Hum', 'Hum', 'That will be about', 'about', 'that will be this evening about twenty minutes to eight', 'And you will see how well I am obeyed', '\"The little prince yawned', 'He was regretting his lost sunset', 'And then, too, he was already beginning to be a little bored', '\"I have nothing more to do here,\" he said to the king', '\"So I shall set out on my way again', '\" \"Do not go,\" said the king, who was very proud of having a subject', '\"Do not go', 'I will make you a Minister', '\" \"Minister of what', '\" \"Minster of', 'of Justice', '\" \"But there is nobody here to judge', '\" \"We do not know that,\" the king said to him', '\"I have not yet made a complete tour of my kingdom', 'I am very old', 'There is no room here for a carriage', 'And it tires me to walk', '\" \"Oh, but I have looked already', '\" said the little prince, turning around to give one more glance to the other side of the planet', 'On that side, as on this, there was nobody at all', '\"Then you shall judge yourself,\" the king answered', '\"That is the most difficult thing of all', 'It is much more difficult to judge yourself than to judge others', 'If you succeed in judging yourself rightly, then you are indeed a man of true wisdom', '\"\"Yes,\" said the little prince, \"but I can judge myself anywhere', 'I do not need to live on this planet', '\"Hum', 'Hum', '\" said the king', '\"I have good reason to believe that somewhere on my planet there is an old rat', 'I hear him at night', 'You can judge this old rat', 'From time to time you will condemn him to death', 'Thus his life will depend on your justice', 'But you will pardon him on each occasion; for he must be treated thriftily', 'He is the only one we have', '\"\"I,\" replied the little prince, \"do not like to condemn anyone to death', 'And now I think I will go on my way', '\" \"No,\" said the king', 'But the little prince, having now completed his preparations for departure, had no wish to grieve the old monarch', '\"If Your Majesty wishes to be promptly obeyed,\" he said, \"he should be able to give me a reasonable order', 'He should be able, for example, to order me to be gone by the end of one minute', 'It seems to me that conditions are favorable', '\" As the king made no answer, the little prince hesitated a moment', 'Then, with a sigh, he took his leave', '\"I made you my Ambassador,\" the king called out, hastily', 'He had a magnificent air of authority', '\"The grown-ups are very strange,\" the little prince said to himself, as he continued on his journey', 'The second planet was inhabited by a conceited man', '\"Ah', 'Ah', 'I am about to receive a visit from an admirer', '\" he exclaimed from afar, when he first saw the little prince coming', 'For, to conceited men, all other men are admirers', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"That is a queer hat you are wearing', '\"\"It is a hat for salutes,\" the conceited man replied', '\"It is to rise in salute when people acclaim me', 'Unfortunately, nobody at all ever passes this way', '\"\"Yes', '\" said the little prince, who did not understand what the conceited man was talking about', '\"Clap your hands, one against the other,\" the conceited man now directed him', 'The little prince clapped his hands', 'The conceited man raised his hat in a modest salute', '\"This is more entertaining than the visit to the king,\" the little prince said to himself', 'And he began again to clap his hands, one against the other', 'The conceited man against raised his hat in salute', \"After five minutes of this exercise the little prince grew tired of the game's monotony\", '\"And what should one do to make the hat come down', '\" he asked', 'But the conceited man did not hear him', 'Conceited people never hear anything but praise', '\"Do you really admire me very much', '\" he demanded of the little prince', '\"What does that mean, \\'admire\\'', '\"\"To admire means that you regard me as the handsomest, the best-dressed, the richest, and the most intelligent man on this planet', '\" \"But you are the only man on your planet', '\" \"Do me this kindness', 'Admire me just the same', '\"\"I admire you,\" said the little prince, shrugging his shoulders slightly, \"but what is there in that to interest you so much', '\"And the little prince went away', '\"The grown-ups are certainly very odd,\" he said to himself, as he continued on his journey', 'The next planet was inhabited by a tippler', 'This was a very short visit, but it plunged the little prince into deep dejection', '\"What are you doing there', '\" he said to the tippler, whom he found settled down in silence before a collection of empty bottles and also a collection of full bottles', '\"I am drinking,\" replied the tippler, with a lugubrious air', '\"Why are you drinking', '\" demanded the little prince', '\"So that I may forget,\" replied the tippler', '\"Forget what', '\" inquired the little prince, who already was sorry for him', '\"Forget that I am ashamed,\" the tippler confessed, hanging his head', '\"Ashamed of what', '\" insisted the little prince, who wanted to help him', '\"Ashamed of drinking', '\" The tippler brought his speech to an end, and shut himself up in an impregnable silence', 'And the little prince went away, puzzled', '\"The grown-ups are certainly very, very odd,\" he said to himself, as he continued on his journey', 'The fourth planet belonged to a businessman', \"This man was so much occupied that he did not even raise his head at the little prince's arrival\", '\"Good morning,\" the little prince said to him', '\"Your cigarette has gone out', '\"\"Three and two make five', 'Five and seven make twelve', 'Twelve and three make fifteen', 'Good morning', 'Fifteen and seven make twenty-two', 'Twenty-two and six make twenty-eight', \"I haven't time to light it again\", 'Twenty-six and five make thirty-one', 'Phew', 'Then that makes five-hundred-and-one-million, six-hundred-twenty-two-thousand, and seven-hundred-thirty-one', '\"\"Five hundred million what', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Eh', 'Are you still there', \"Five-hundred-and-one million, I can't stop\", 'I have so much to do', 'I am concerned with matters of consequence', \"I don't amuse myself with balderdash\", 'Two and five make seven', '\"\"Five-hundred-and-one million what', '\" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question once he had asked it', 'The businessman raised his head', '\"During the fifty-four years that I have inhabited this planet, I have been disturbed only three times', 'The first time was twenty-two years ago, when some giddy goose fell from goodness knows where', 'He made the most frightful noise that resounded all over the place, and I made four mistakes in my addition', 'The second time, eleven years ago, I was disturbed by an attack of rheumatism', \"I don't get enough exercise\", 'I have no time for loafing', 'The third time, well, this is it', 'I was saying, then, five -hundred-and-one millions\"\"Millions of what', '\" The businessman suddenly realized that there was no hope of being left in peace until he answered this question', '\"Millions of those little objects,\" he said, \"which one sometimes sees in the sky', '\" \"Flies', '\" \"Oh, no', 'Little glittering objects', '\" \"Bees', '\" \"Oh, no', 'Little golden objects that set lazy men to idle dreaming', 'As for me, I am concerned with matters of consequence', 'There is no time for idle dreaming in my life', '\" \"Ah', 'You mean the stars', '\" \"Yes, that\\'s it', 'The stars', '\" \"And what do you do with five-hundred millions of stars', '\" \"Five-hundred-and-one million, six-hundred-twenty-two thousand, seven-hundred-thirty-one', 'I am concerned with matters of consequence: I am accurate', '\"\"And what do you do with these stars', '\" \"What do I do with them', '\" \"Yes', '\" \"Nothing', 'I own them', '\" \"You own the stars', '\" \"Yes', '\" \"But I have already seen a king who', '\" \"Kings do not own, they reign over', 'It is a very different matter', '\"\"And what good does it do you to own the stars', '\" \"It does me the good of making me rich', '\"\"And what good does it do you to be rich', '\"\"It makes it possible for me to buy more stars, if any are ever discovered', '\"\"This man,\" the little prince said to himself, \"reasons a little like my poor tippler', '\" Nevertheless, he still had some more questions', '\"How is it possible for one to own the stars', '\" \"To whom do they belong', '\" the businessman retorted, peevishly', '\"I don\\'t know', 'To nobody', '\" \"Then they belong to me, because I was the first person to think of it', '\" \"Is that all that is necessary', '\" \"Certainly', 'When you find a diamond that belongs to nobody, it is yours', 'When you discover an island that belongs to nobody, it is yours', 'When you get an idea before anyone else, you take out a patent on it: it is yours', 'So with me: I own the stars, because nobody else before me ever thought of owning them', '\"\"Yes, that is true,\" said the little prince', '\"And what do you do with them', '\"\"I administer them,\" replied the businessman', '\"I count them and recount them', 'It is difficult', 'But I am a man who is naturally interested in matters of consequence', '\"The little prince was still not satisfied', '\"If I owned a silk scarf,\" he said, \"I could put it around my neck and take it away with me', 'If I owned a flower, I could pluck that flower and take it away with me', 'But you cannot pluck the stars from heaven', '\"\"No', 'But I can put them in the bank', '\" \"Whatever does that mean', '\" \"That means that I write the number of my stars on a little paper', 'And then I put this paper in a drawer and lock it with a key', '\"\"And that is all', '\"\"That is enough,\" said the businessman', '\"It is entertaining,\" thought the little prince', '\"It is rather poetic', 'But it is of no great consequence', '\" On matters of consequence, the little prince had ideas which were very different from those of the grown-ups', '\"I myself own a flower,\" he continued his conversation with the businessman, \"which I water every day', 'I own three volcanoes, which I clean out every week (for I also clean out the one that is extinct; one never knows)', 'It is of some use to my volcanoes, and it is of some use to my flower, that I own them', 'But you are of no use to the stars', '\"The businessman opened his mouth, but he found nothing to say in answer', 'And the little prince went away', '\"The grown-ups are certainly altogether extraordinary,\" he said simply, talking to himself as he continued on his journey', 'The fifth planet was very strange', 'It was the smallest of all', 'There was just enough room on it for a street lamp and a lamplighter', 'The little prince was not able to reach any explanation of the use of a street lamp and a lamplighter, somewhere in the heavens, on a planet which had no people, and not one house', 'But he said to himself, nevertheless: \"It may well be that this man is absurd', 'But he is not so absurd as the king, the conceited man, the businessman, and the tippler', 'For at least his work has some meaning', 'When he lights his street lamp, it is as if he brought one more star to life, or one flower', 'When he puts out his lamp, he sends the flower, or the star, to sleep', 'That is a beautiful occupation', 'And since it is beautiful, it is truly useful', '\"When he arrived in the planet he respectfully saluted the lamplighter', '\"Good morning', 'Why have you just put out your lamp', '\"\"Those are the orders,\" replied the lamplighter', '\"Good morning', '\"\"What are the orders', '\"\"The orders are that I put out my lamp', 'Good evening', '\" And he lighted his lamp again', '\"But why have you just lighted it again', '\"\"Those are the orders,\" replied the lamplighter', '\"I do not understand,\" said the little prince', '\"There is nothing to understand,\" said the lamplighter', '\"Orders are orders', 'Good morning', '\" And he put out his lamp', 'Then he mopped his forehead with a handkerchief decorated with red squares', '\"I follow a terrible profession', 'In the old days it was reasonable', 'I put the lamp out in the morning, and in the evening I lighted it again', 'I had the rest of the day for relaxation and the rest of the night for sleep', '\"\"And the orders have been changed since that time', '\"\"The orders have not been changed,\" said the lamplighter', '\"That is the tragedy', 'From year to year the planet has turned more rapidly and the orders have not been changed', '\"\"Then what', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Then the planet now makes a complete turn every minute, and I no longer have a single second for repose', 'Once every minute I have to light my lamp and put it out', '\"\"That is very funny', 'A day lasts only one minute, here where you live', '\"\"It is not funny at all', '\" said the lamplighter', '\"While we have been talking together a month has gone by', '\"\"A month', '\"\"Yes, a month', 'Thirty minutes', 'Thirty days', 'Good evening', '\" And he lighted his lamp again', 'As the little prince watched him, he felt that he loved this lamplighter who was so faithful to his orders', 'He remembered the sunsets which he himself had gone to seek, in other days, merely by pulling up his chair; and he wanted to help his friend', '\"You know,\" he said, \"I can tell you a way you can rest whenever you want to', '\"\"I always want to rest,\" said the lamplighter', 'For it is possible for a man to be faithful and lazy at the same time', 'The little prince went on with his explanation: \"Your planet is so small that three strides will take you all the way around it', 'To be always in the sunshine, you need only walk along rather slowly', 'When you want to rest, you will walk and the day will last as long as you like', '\"\"That doesn\\'t do me much good,\" said the lamplighter', '\"The one thing I love in life is to sleep', '\"\"Then you\\'re unlucky,\" said the little prince', '\"I am unlucky,\" said the lamplighter', '\"Good morning', '\" And he put out his lamp', '\"That man,\" said the little prince to himself, as he continued farther on his journey, \"that man would be scorned by all the others: by the king, by the conceited man, by the tippler, by the businessman', 'Nevertheless he is the only one of them all who does not seem to me ridiculous', 'Perhaps that is because he is thinking of something else besides himself', '\"He breathed a sigh of regret, and said to himself, again: \"That man is the only one of them all whom I could have made my friend', 'But his planet is indeed too small', 'There is no room on it for two people', '\" What the little prince did not dare confess was that he was sorry most of all to leave this planet, because it was blest every day with 1440 sunsets', 'The sixth planet was ten times larger than the last one', 'It was inhabited by an old gentleman who wrote voluminous books', '\"Oh, look', 'Here is an explorer', '\" he exclaimed to himself when he saw the little prince coming', 'The little prince sat down on the table and panted a little', 'He had already traveled so much and so far', '\"Where do you come from', '\" the old gentleman said to him', '\"What is that big book', '\" said the little prince', '\"What are you doing', '\"\"I am a geographer,\" the old gentleman said to him', '\"What is a geographer', '\" asked the little prince', '\"A geographer is a scholar who knows the location of all the seas, rivers, towns, mountains, and deserts', '\"\"That is very interesting,\" said the little prince', '\"Here at last is a man who has a real profession', '\" And he cast a look around him at the planet of the geographer', 'It was the most magnificent and stately planet that he had ever seen', '\"Your planet is very beautiful,\" he said', '\"Has it any oceans', '\"\"I couldn\\'t tell you,\" said the geographer', '\"Ah', '\" The little prince was disappointed', '\"Has it any mountains', '\"\"I couldn\\'t tell you,\" said the geographer', '\"And towns, and rivers, and deserts', '\"\"I couldn\\'t tell you that, either', '\"\"But you are a geographer', '\"\"Exactly,\" the geographer said', '\"But I am not an explorer', \"I haven't a single explorer on my planet\", 'It is not the geographer who goes out to count the towns, the rivers, the mountains, the seas, the oceans, and the deserts', 'The geographer is much too important to go loafing about', 'He does not leave his desk', 'But he receives the explorers in his study', 'He asks them questions, and he notes down what they recall of their travels', \"And if the recollections of any one among them seem interesting to him, the geographer orders an inquiry into that explorer's moral character\", '\"\"Why is that', '\"\"Because an explorer who told lies would bring disaster on the books of the geographer', 'So would do an explorer who drank too much', '\"\"Why is that', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Because intoxicated men see double', 'Then the geographer would note down two mountains in a place where there was only one', '\"\"I know someone,\" said the little prince, \"who would make a bad explorer', '\"\"That is possible', 'Then, when the moral character of the explorer is shown to be good, an inquiry is ordered into his discovery', '\"\"One goes to see it', '\"\"No', 'That would be too complicated', 'But one requires the explorer to furnish proofs', 'For example, if the discovery in question is that of a large mountain, one requires that large stones be brought back from it', '\" The geographer was suddenly stirred to excitement', '\"But you you come from far away', 'You are an explorer', 'You shall describe your planet to me', '\" And, having opened his big register, the geographer sharpened his pencil', 'The recitals of explorers are put down first in pencil', 'One waits until the explorer has furnished proofs, before putting them down in ink', '\"Well', '\" said the geographer expectantly', '\"Oh, where I live,\" said the little prince, \"it is not very interesting', 'It is all so small', 'I have three volcanoes', 'Two volcanoes are active and the other is extinct', 'But one never knows', '\"\"One never knows,\" said the geographer', '\"I have also a flower', '\"\"We do not record flowers,\" said the geographer', '\"Why is that', 'The flower is the most beautiful thing on my planet', '\"\"We do not record them,\" said the geographer, \"because they are ephemeral', '\"\"What does that mean \\'ephemeral\\'', '\"\"Geographies,\" said the geographer, \"are the books which, of all books, are most concerned with matters of consequence', 'They never become old-fashioned', 'It is very rarely that a mountain changes its position', 'It is very rarely that an ocean empties itself of its waters', 'We write of eternal things', '\"\"But extinct volcanoes may come to life again,\" the little prince interrupted', '\"What does that mean \\'ephemeral\\'', '\"\"Whether volcanoes are extinct or alive, it comes to the same thing for us,\" said the geographer', '\"The thing that matters to us is the mountain', 'It does not change', '\"\"But what does that mean \\'ephemeral\\'', '\" repeated the little prince, who never in his life had let go of a question, once he had asked it', '\"It means, \\'which is in danger of speedy disappearance', '\\' \"\"Is my flower in danger of speedy disappearance', '\"\"Certainly it is', '\"\"My flower is ephemeral,\" the little prince said to himself, \"and she has only four thorns to defend herself against the world', 'And I have left her on my planet, all alone', '\"That was his first moment of regret', 'But he took courage once more', '\"What place would you advise me to visit now', '\" he asked', '\"The planet Earth,\" replied the geographer', '\"It has a good reputation', '\" And the little prince went away, thinking of his flower', 'So then the seventh planet was the Earth', 'The Earth is not just an ordinary planet', 'One can count, there 111 kings (not forgetting, to be sure, the Negro kings among them), 7000 geographers, 900,000 businessmen, 7,500,000 tipplers, 311,000,000 conceited men, that is to say, about 2,000,000,000 grown-ups', 'To give you an idea of the size of the Earth, I will tell you that before the invention of electricity it was necessary to maintain, over the whole of the six continents, a veritable army of 462,511 lamplighters for the street lamps', 'Seen from a slight distance, that would make a splendid spectacle', 'The movements of this army would be regulated like those of the ballet in the opera', 'First would come the turn of the lamplighters of New Zealand and Australia', 'Having set their lamps alight, these would go off to sleep', 'Next, the lamplighters of China and Siberia would enter for their steps in the dance, and then they too would be waved back into the wings', 'After that would come the turn of the lamplighters of Russia and the Indies; then those of Africa and Europe, then those of South America; then those of North America', 'And never would they make a mistake in the order of their entry upon the stage', 'It would be magnificent', 'Only the man who was in charge of the single lamp at the North Pole, and his colleague who was responsible for the single lamp at the South Pole, only these two would live free from toil and care: they would be busy twice a year', 'When one wishes to play the wit, he sometimes wanders a little from the truth', 'I have not been altogether honest in what I have told you about the lamplighters', 'And I realize that I run the risk of giving a false idea of our planet to those who do not know it', 'Men occupy a very small place upon the Earth', 'If the two billion inhabitants who people its surface were all to stand upright and somewhat crowded together, as they do for some big public assembly, they could easily be put into one public square twenty miles long and twenty miles wide', 'All humanity could be piled up on a small Pacific islet', 'The grown-ups, to be sure, will not believe you when you tell them that', 'They imagine that they fill a great deal of space', 'They fancy themselves as important as the baobabs', 'You should advise them, then, to make their own calculations', 'They adore figures, and that will please them', 'But do not waste your time on this extra task', 'It is unnecessary', 'You have, I know, confidence in me', 'When the little prince arrived on the Earth, he was very much surprised not to see any people', 'He was beginning to be afraid he had come to the wrong planet, when a coil of gold, the color of the moonlight, flashed across the sand', '\"Good evening,\" said the little prince courteously', '\"Good evening,\" said the snake', '\"What planet is this on which I have come down', '\" asked the little prince', '\"This is the Earth; this is Africa,\" the snake answered', '\"Ah', 'Then there are no people on the Earth', '\"\"This is the desert', 'There are no people in the desert', 'The Earth is large,\" said the snake', 'The little prince sat down on a stone, and raised his eyes toward the sky', '\"I wonder,\" he said, \"whether the stars are set alight in heaven so that one day each one of us may find his own again', 'Look at my planet', 'It is right there above us', 'But how far away it is', '\"\"It is beautiful,\" the snake said', '\"What has brought you here', '\"\"I have been having some trouble with a flower,\" said the little prince', '\"Ah', '\" said the snake', 'And they were both silent', '\"Where are the men', '\" the little prince at last took up the conversation again', '\"It is a little lonely in the desert', '\"\"It is also lonely among men,\" the snake said', 'The little prince gazed at him for a long time', '\"You are a funny animal,\" he said at last', '\"You are no thicker than a finger', '\"\"But I am more powerful than the finger of a king,\" said the snake', 'The little prince smiled', '\"You are not very powerful', \"You haven't even any feet\", 'You cannot even travel', '\"\"I can carry you farther than any ship could take you,\" said the snake', \"He twined himself around the little prince's ankle, like a golden bracelet\", '\"Whomever I touch, I send back to the earth from whence he came,\" the snake spoke again', '\"But you are innocent and true, and you come from a star', '\"The little prince made no reply', '\"You move me to pity, you are so weak on this Earth made of granite,\" the snake said', '\"I can help you, some day, if you grow too homesick for your own planet', 'I can', '\"\"Oh', 'I understand you very well,\" said the little prince', '\"But why do you always speak in riddles', '\"\"I solve them all,\" said the snake', 'And they were both silent', 'The little prince crossed the desert and met with only one flower', 'It was a flower with three petals, a flower of no account at all', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"Good morning,\" said the flower', '\"Where are the men', '\" the little prince asked, politely', 'The flower had once seen a caravan passing', '\"Men', '\" she echoed', '\"I think there are six or seven of them in existence', 'I saw them, several years ago', 'But one never knows where to find them', 'The wind blows them away', 'They have no roots, and that makes their life very difficult', '\"\"Goodbye,\" said the little prince', '\"Goodbye,\" said the flower', 'After that, the little prince climbed a high mountain', 'The only mountains he had ever known were the three volcanoes, which came up to his knees', 'And he used the extinct volcano as a footstool', '\"From a mountain as high as this one,\" he said to himself, \"I shall be able to see the whole planet at one glance, and all the people', '\" But he saw nothing, save peaks of rock that were sharpened like needles', '\"Good morning,\" he said courteously', '\"Good morning', 'Good morning', 'Good morning,\" answered the echo', '\"Who are you', '\" said the little prince', '\"Who are you', 'Who are you', 'Who are you', '\" answered the echo', '\"Be my friends', 'I am all alone,\" he said', '\"I am all alone', 'all alone', 'all alone,\" answered the echo', '\"What a queer planet', '\" he thought', '\"It is altogether dry, and altogether pointed, and altogether harsh and forbidding', 'And the people have no imagination', 'They repeat whatever one says to them', 'On my planet I had a flower; she always was the first to speak', '\"But it happened that after walking for a long time through sand, and rocks, and snow, the little prince at last came upon a road', 'And all roads lead to the abodes of men', '\"Good morning,\" he said', 'He was standing before a garden, all a-bloom with roses', '\"Good morning,\" said the roses', 'The little prince gazed at them', 'They all looked like his flower', '\"Who are you', '\" he demanded, thunderstruck', '\"We are roses,\" the roses said', 'And he was overcome with sadness', 'His flower had told him that she was the only one of her kind in the entire universe', 'And here were five thousand of them, all alike, in one single garden', '\"She would be very much annoyed,\" he said to himself, \"if she should see that', 'she would cough most dreadfully, and she would pretend that she was dying, to avoid being laughed at', 'And I should be obliged to pretend that I was nursing her back to life, for if I did not do that, to humble myself also, she would really allow herself to die', '\"Then he went on with his reflections: \"I thought that I was rich, with a flower that was unique in the entire world; and all I had was a common rose', 'A common rose, and three volcanoes that come up to my knees-- and one of them perhaps extinct forever', \"that doesn't make me a very great prince\", '\" And he lay down in the grass and cried', 'It was then that the fox appeared', '\"Good morning,\" said the fox', '\"Good morning,\" the little prince responded politely, although when he turned around he saw nothing', '\"I am right here,\" the voice said, \"under the apple tree', '\" \"Who are you', '\" asked the little prince, and added, \"You are very pretty to look at', '\"\"I am a fox,\" said the fox', '\"Come and play with me,\" proposed the little prince', '\"I am so unhappy', '\" \"I cannot play with you,\" the fox said', '\"I am not tamed', '\"\"Ah', 'Please excuse me,\" said the little prince', 'But, after some thought, he added: \"What does that mean, \\'tame\\'', '\"\"You do not live here,\" said the fox', '\"What is it that you are looking for', '\"\"I am looking for men,\" said the little prince', '\"What does that mean, \\'tame\\'', '\"\"Men,\" said the fox', '\"They have guns, and they hunt', 'It is very disturbing', 'They also raise chickens', 'These are their only interests', 'Are you looking for chickens', '\"\"No,\" said the little prince', '\"I am looking for friends', \"What does that mean, 'tame'\", '\"\"It is an act too often neglected,\" said the fox', 'It means to establish ties', '\"\"To establish ties', '\"\"Just that,\" said the fox', '\"To me, you are still nothing more than a little boy who is just like a hundred thousand other little boys', 'And I have no need of you', 'And you, on your part, have no need of me', 'To you, I am nothing more than a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes', 'But if you tame me, then we shall need each other', 'To me, you will be unique in the entire world', 'To you, I shall be unique in the entire world', '\"\"I am beginning to understand,\" said the little prince', '\"There is a flower', 'I think that she has tamed me', '\"\"It is possible,\" said the fox', '\"On the Earth one sees all sorts of things', '\"\"Oh, but this is not on the Earth', '\" said the little prince', 'The fox seemed perplexed, and very curious', '\"On another planet', '\"\"Yes', '\"\"Are there hunters on this planet', '\"\"No', '\"\"Ah, that is interesting', 'Are there chickens', '\"\"No', '\"\"Nothing is perfect,\" sighed the fox', 'But he came back to his idea', '\"My life is very monotonous,\" the fox said', '\"I hunt chickens; men hunt me', 'All the chickens are just alike, and all the men are just alike', 'And, in consequence, I am a little bored', 'But if you tame me, it will be as if the sun came to shine on my life', 'I shall know the sound of a step that will be different from all the others', 'Other steps send me hurrying back underneath the ground', 'Yours will call me, like music, out of my burrow', 'And then look: you see the grain-fields down yonder', 'I do not eat bread', 'Wheat is of no use to me', 'The wheat fields have nothing to say to me', 'And that is sad', 'But you have hair that is the colour of gold', 'Think how wonderful that will be when you have tamed me', 'The grain, which is also golden, will bring me back the thought of you', 'And I shall love to listen to the wind in the wheat', '\" The fox gazed at the little prince, for a long time', '\"Please, tame me', '\" he said', '\"I want to, very much,\" the little prince replied', '\"But I have not much time', 'I have friends to discover, and a great many things to understand', '\"\"One only understands the things that one tames,\" said the fox', '\"Men have no more time to understand anything', 'They buy things all ready-made at the shops', 'But there is no shop anywhere where one can buy friendship, and so men have no friends any more', 'If you want a friend, tame me', '\"\"What must I do, to tame you', '\" asked the little prince', '\"You must be very patient,\" replied the fox', '\"First you will sit down at a little distance from me, like that, in the grass', 'I shall look at you out of the corner of my eye, and you will say nothing', 'Words are the source of misunderstandings', 'But you will sit a little closer to me, every day', '\"The next day the little prince came back', '\"It would have been better to come back at the same hour,\" said the fox', '\"If, for example, you come at four o\\'clock in the afternoon, then at three o\\'clock I shall begin to be happy', 'I shall feel happier and happier as the hour advances', \"At four o'clock, I shall already be worrying and jumping about\", 'I shall show you how happy I am', 'But if you come at just any time, I shall never know at what hour my heart is to be ready to greet you', 'One must observe the proper rites', '\"\"What is a rite', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Those also are actions too often neglected,\" said the fox', '\"They are what make one day different from other days, one hour from other hours', 'There is a rite, for example, among my hunters', 'Every Thursday they dance with the village girls', 'So Thursday is a wonderful day for me', 'I can take a walk as far as the vineyards', 'But if the hunters danced at just any time, every day would be like every other day, and I should never have any vacation at all', '\"So the little prince tamed the fox', 'And when the hour of his departure drew near', '\"Ah,\" said the fox, \"I shall cry', '\"\"It is your own fault,\" said the little prince', '\"I never wished you any sort of harm; but you wanted me to tame you', '\"\"Yes, that is so,\" said the fox', '\"But now you are going to cry', '\" said the little prince', '\"Yes, that is so,\" said the fox', '\"Then it has done you no good at all', '\"\"It has done me good,\" said the fox, \"because of the color of the wheat fields', '\" And then he added: \"Go and look again at the roses', 'You will understand now that yours is unique in the entire world', 'Then come back to say goodbye to me, and I will make you a present of a secret', '\"The little prince went away, to look again at the roses', '\"You are not at all like my rose,\" he said', '\"As yet you are nothing', 'No one has tamed you, and you have tamed no one', 'You are like my fox when I first knew him', 'He was only a fox like a hundred thousand other foxes', 'But I have made him my friend, and now he is unique in the entire world', '\" And the roses were very much embarrassed', '\"You are beautiful, but you are empty,\" he went on', '\"One could not die for you', 'To be sure, an ordinary passerby would think that my rose looked just like you, the rose that belongs to me', 'But in herself alone she is more important than all the hundreds of your other roses: because it is she that I have watered; because it is she that I have put under the glass globe; because it is she that I have sheltered behind the screen; because it is for her that I have killed the caterpillars (except the two or three that we saved to become butterflies); because it is she that I have listened to, when she grumbled, or boasted, or even sometimes when she said nothing', 'Because she is my rose', 'And he went back to meet the fox', '\"Goodbye,\" he said', '\"Goodbye,\" said the fox', '\"And now here is my secret, a very simple secret: It is only with the heart that one can see rightly; what is essential is invisible to the eye', '\"\"What is essential is invisible to the eye,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember', '\"It is the time you have wasted for your rose that makes your rose so important', '\"\"It is the time I have wasted for my rose', '\" said the little prince, so that he would be sure to remember', '\"Men have forgotten this truth,\" said the fox', '\"But you must not forget it', 'You become responsible, forever, for what you have tamed', 'You are responsible for your rose', '\"\"I am responsible for my rose,\" the little prince repeated, so that he would be sure to remember', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"Good morning,\" said the railway switchman', '\"What do you do here', '\" the little prince asked', '\"I sort out travelers, in bundles of a thousand,\" said the switchman', '\"I send off the trains that carry them; now to the right, now to the left', '\" And a brilliantly lighted express train shook the switchman\\'s cabin as it rushed by with a roar like thunder', '\"They are in a great hurry,\" said the little prince', '\"What are they looking for', '\"\"Not even the locomotive engineer knows that,\" said the switchman', 'And a second brilliantly lighted express thundered by, in the opposite direction', '\"Are they coming back already', '\" demanded the little prince', '\"These are not the same ones,\" said the switchman', '\"It is an exchange', '\"\"Were they not satisfied where they were', '\" asked the little prince', '\"No one is ever satisfied where he is,\" said the switchman', 'And they heard the roaring thunder of a third brilliantly lighted express', '\"Are they pursuing the first travelers', '\" demanded the little prince', '\"They are pursuing nothing at all,\" said the switchman', '\"They are asleep in there, or if they are not asleep they are yawning', 'Only the children are flattening their noses against the windowpanes', '\"\"Only the children know what they are looking for,\" said the little prince', '\"They waste their time over a rag doll and it becomes very important to them; and if anybody takes it away from them, they cry', '\" \"They are lucky,\" the switchman said', '\"Good morning,\" said the little prince', '\"Good morning,\" said the merchant', 'This was a merchant who sold pills that had been invented to quench thirst', 'You need only swallow one pill a week and you would feel no need of anything to drink', '\"Why are you selling those', '\" asked the little prince', '\"Because they save a tremendous amount of time,\" said the merchant', '\"Computations have been made by experts', 'With these pills, you save fifty-three minutes in every week', '\"\"And what do I do with those fifty-three minutes', '\"\"Anything you like', '\"\"As for me,\" said the little prince to himself, \"if I had fifty-three minutes to spend as I liked, I should walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water', '\"It was now the eighth day since I had had my accident in the desert, and I had listened to the story of the merchant as I was drinking the last drops of my water supply', '\"Ah,\" I said to the little prince, \"these memories of yours are very charming; but I have not yet succeeded in repairing my plane; I have nothing more to drink; and I, too, should be very happy if I could walk at my leisure toward a spring of fresh water', '\"\"My friend the fox', '\" the little prince said to me', '\"My dear little man, this is no longer a matter that has anything to do with the fox', '\"\"Why not', '\"\"Because I am about to die of thirst', '\"He did not follow my reasoning, and he answered me: \"It is a good thing to have had a friend, even if one is about to die', 'I, for instance, am very glad to have had a fox as a friend', '\"\"He has no way of guessing the danger,\" I said to myself', '\"He has never been either hungry or thirsty', 'A little sunshine is all he needs', '\"But he looked at me steadily, and replied to my thought: \"I am thirsty, too', 'Let us look for a well', '\" I made a gesture of weariness', 'It is absurd to look for a well, at random, in the immensity of the desert', 'But nevertheless we started walking', 'When we had trudged along for several hours, in silence, the darkness fell, and the stars began to come out', 'Thirst had made me a little feverish, and I looked at them as if I were in a dream', 'The little prince\\'s last words came reeling back into my memory: \"Then you are thirsty, too', '\" I demanded', 'But he did not reply to my question', 'He merely said to me: \"Water may also be good for the heart', '\"I did not understand this answer, but I said nothing', 'I knew very well that it was impossible to cross-examine him', 'He was tired', 'He sat down', 'I sat down beside him', 'And, after a little silence, he spoke again: \"The stars are beautiful, because of a flower that cannot be seen', '\"I replied, \"Yes, that is so', '\" And, without saying anything more, I looked across the ridges of sand that were stretched out before us in the moonlight', '\"The desert is beautiful,\" the little prince added', 'And that was true', 'I have always loved the desert', 'One sits down on a desert sand dune, sees nothing, hears nothing', 'Yet through the silence something throbs, and gleams', '\"What makes the desert beautiful,\" said the little prince, \"is that somewhere it hides a well', '\"I was astonished by a sudden understanding of that mysterious radiation of the sands', 'When I was a little boy I lived in an old house, and legend told us that a treasure was buried there', 'To be sure, no one had ever known how to find it; perhaps no one had ever even looked for it', 'But it cast an enchantment over that house', 'My home was hiding a secret in the depths of its heart', '\"Yes,\" I said to the little prince', '\"The house, the stars, the desert-- what gives them their beauty is something that is invisible', '\"\"I am glad,\" he said, \"that you agree with my fox', '\" As the little prince dropped off to sleep, I took him in my arms and set out walking once more', 'I felt deeply moved, and stirred', 'It seemed to me that I was carrying a very fragile treasure', 'It seemed to me, even, that there was nothing more fragile on all Earth', 'In the moonlight I looked at his pale forehead, his closed eyes, his locks of hair that trembled in the wind, and I said to myself:\"What I see here is nothing but a shell', 'What is most important is invisible', '\"As his lips opened slightly with the suspicious of a half-smile, I said to myself, again: \"What moves me so deeply, about this little prince who is sleeping here, is his loyalty to a flower-- the image of a rose that shines through his whole being like the flame of a lamp, even when he is asleep', '\"And I felt him to be more fragile still', 'I felt the need of protecting him, as if he himself were a flame that might be extinguished by a little puff of wind', 'And, as I walked on so, I found the well, at daybreak', '\"Men,\" said the little prince, \"set out on their way in express trains, but they do not know what they are looking for', 'Then they rush about, and get excited, and turn round and round', '\" And he added: \"It is not worth the trouble', '\"The well that we had come to was not like the wells of the Sahara', 'The wells of the Sahara are mere holes dug in the sand', 'This one was like a well in a village', 'But there was no village here, and I thought I must be dreaming', '\"It is strange,\" I said to the little prince', '\"Everything is ready for use: the pulley, the bucket, the rope', '\" He laughed, touched the rope, and set the pulley to working', 'And the pulley moaned, like an old weathervane which the wind has long since forgotten', '\"Do you hear', '\" said the little prince', '\"We have wakened the well, and it is singing', '\"I did not want him to tire himself with the rope', '\"Leave it to me,\" I said', '\"It is too heavy for you', '\" I hoisted the bucket slowly to the edge of the well and set it there, happy, tired as I was, over my achievement', 'The song of the pulley was still in my ears, and I could see the sunlight shimmer in the still trembling water', '\"I am thirsty for this water,\" said the little prince', '\"Give me some of it to drink', '\"And I understood what he had been looking for', 'I raised the bucket to his lips', 'He drank, his eyes closed', 'It was as sweet as some special festival treat', 'This water was indeed a different thing from ordinary nourishment', 'Its sweetness was born of the walk under the stars, the song of the pulley, the effort of my arms', 'It was good for the heart, like a present', 'When I was a little boy, the lights of the Christmas tree, the music of the Midnight Mass, the tenderness of smiling faces, used to make up, so, the radiance of the gifts I received', '\"The men where you live,\" said the little prince, \"raise five thousand roses in the same garden and they do not find in it what they are looking for', '\"\"They do not find it,\" I replied', '\"And yet what they are looking for could be found in one single rose, or in a little water', '\"\"Yes, that is true,\" I said', 'And the little prince added: \"But the eyes are blind', 'One must look with the heart', '\"I had drunk the water', 'I breathed easily', 'At sunrise the sand is the color of honey', 'And that honey color was making me happy, too', 'What brought me, then, this sense of grief', '\"You must keep your promise,\" said the little prince, softly, as he sat down beside me once more', '\"What promise', '\" \"You know, a muzzle for my sheep', 'I am responsible for this flower', '\"I took my rough drafts of drawings out of my pocket', 'The little prince looked them over, and laughed as he said:\"Your baobabs, they look a little like cabbages', '\"\"Oh', '\" I had been so proud of my baobabs', '\"Your fox, his ears look a little like horns; and they are too long', '\" And he laughed again', '\"You are not fair, little prince,\" I said', '\"I don\\'t know how to draw anything except boa constrictors from the outside and boa constrictors from the inside', '\"\"Oh, that will be all right,\" he said, \"children understand', '\"So then I made a pencil sketch of a muzzle', 'And as I gave it to him my heart was torn', '\"You have plans that I do not know about,\" I said', 'But he did not answer me', 'He said to me, instead: \"You know, my descent to the earth', 'Tomorrow will be its anniversary', '\" Then, after a silence, he went on: \"I came down very near here', '\" And he flushed', 'And once again, without understanding why, I had a queer sense of sorrow', 'One question, however, occurred to me: \"Then it was not by chance that on the morning when I first met you-- a week ago-- you were strolling along like that, all alone, a thousand miles from any inhabited region', 'You were on the your way back to the place where you landed', '\"The little prince flushed again', 'And I added, with some hesitancy: \"Perhaps it was because of the anniversary', '\" The little prince flushed once more', 'He never answered questions, but when one flushes does that not mean \"Yes\"', '\"Ah,\" I said to him, \"I am a little frightened', '\"But he interrupted me', '\"Now you must work', 'You must return to your engine', 'I will be waiting for you here', 'Come back tomorrow evening', '\"But I was not reassured', 'I remembered the fox', 'One runs the risk of weeping a little, if one lets himself be tamed', 'Beside the well there was the ruin of an old stone wall', 'When I came back from my work, the next evening, I saw from some distance away my little prince sitting on top of a wall, with his feet dangling', 'And I heard him say: \"Then you don\\'t remember', 'This is not the exact spot', '\" Another voice must have answered him, for he replied to it: \"Yes, yes', 'It is the right day, but this is not the place', '\"I continued my walk toward the wall', 'At no time did I see or hear anyone', 'The little prince, however, replied once again: \"', 'Exactly', 'You will see where my track begins, in the sand', 'You have nothing to do but wait for me there', 'I shall be there tonight', '\"I was only twenty metres from the wall, and I still saw nothing', 'After a silence the little prince spoke again: \"You have good poison', 'You are sure that it will not make me suffer too long', '\" I stopped in my tracks, my heart torn asunder; but still I did not understand', '\"Now go away,\" said the little prince', '\"I want to get down from the wall', '\"I dropped my eyes, then, to the foot of the wall', 'and I leaped into the air', 'There before me, facing the little prince was one of those yellow snakes that take just thirty seconds to bring your life to an end', 'Even as I was digging into my pocked to get out my revolver I made a running step back', 'But, at the noise I made, the snake let himself flow easily across the sand like the dying spray of a fountain, and, in no apparent hurry, disappeared, with a light metallic sound, among the stones', 'I reached the wall just in time to catch my little man in my arms; his face was white as snow', '\"What does this mean', '\" I demanded', '\"Why are you talking with snakes', '\"I had loosened the golden muffler that he always wore', 'I had moistened his temples, and had given him some water to drink', 'And now I did not dare ask him any more questions', 'He looked at me very gravely, and put his arms around my neck', \"I felt his heart beating like the heart of a dying bird, shot with someone's rifle\", '\"I am glad that you have found what the matter with your engine was,\" he said', '\"Now you can go back home\"\"How do you know about that', '\" I was just coming to tell him that my work had been successful, beyond anything that I had dared to hope', 'He made no answer to my question, but he added: \"I, too, am going back home today', '\" Then, sadly, \"It is much farther', 'it is much more difficult', '\" I realized clearly that something extraordinary was happening', 'I was holding him close in my arms as if he were a little child; and yet it seemed to me that he was rushing headlong toward an abyss from which I could do nothing to restrain him', 'His look was very serious, like someone lost far away', '\"I have your sheep', \"And I have the sheep's box\", 'And I have the muzzle', '\"And he gave me a sad smile', 'I waited a long time', 'I could see that he was reviving little by little', '\"Dear little man,\" I said to him, \"you are afraid', '\" He was afraid; there was no doubt about that', 'But he laughed lightly', '\"I shall be much more afraid this evening', '\"Once again I felt myself frozen by the sense of something irreparable', 'And I knew that I could not bear the thought of never hearing that laughter any more', 'For me, it was like a spring of fresh water in the desert', '\"Little man,\" I said, \"I want to hear you laugh again', '\" But he said to me: \"Tonight, it will be a year', 'my star, then, can be found right above the place where I came to the Earth, a year ago', '\"\"Little man,\" I said, \"tell me that it is only a bad dream, this affair of the snake, and the meeting-place, and the star', '\" But he did not answer my plea', 'He said to me, instead: \"The thing that is important is the thing that is not seen', '\" \"Yes, I know', '\"\"It is just as it is with the flower', 'If you love a flower that lives on a star, it is sweet to look at the sky at night', 'All the stars are a-bloom with flowers', '\"\"Yes, I know', '\"\"It is just as it is with the water', 'Because of the pulley, and the rope, what you gave me to drink was like music', 'You remember how good it was', '\"\"Yes, I know', '\"\"And at night you will look up at the stars', 'Where I live everything is so small that I cannot show you where my star is to be found', 'It is better, like that', 'My star will just be one of the stars, for you', 'And so you will love to watch all the stars in the heavens', 'they will all be your friends', 'And, besides, I am going to make you a present', '\" He laughed again', '\"Ah, little prince, dear little prince', 'I love to hear that laughter', '\"\"That is my present', 'Just that', 'It will be as it was when we drank the water', '\"\"What are you trying to say', '\"\"All men have the stars,\" he answered, \"but they are not the same things for different people', 'For some, who are travelers, the stars are guides', 'For others they are no more than little lights in the sky', 'For others, who are scholars, they are problems', 'For my businessman they were wealth', 'But all these stars are silent', 'You, you alone, will have the stars as no one else has them\"\"What are you trying to say', '\"\"In one of the stars I shall be living', 'In one of them I shall be laughing', 'And so it will be as if all the stars were laughing, when you look at the sky at night', 'you, only you, will have stars that can laugh', '\"And he laughed again', '\"And when your sorrow is comforted (time soothes all sorrows) you will be content that you have known me', 'You will always be my friend', 'You will want to laugh with me', 'And you will sometimes open your window, so, for that pleasure', 'and your friends will be properly astonished to see you laughing as you look up at the sky', \"Then you will say to them, 'Yes, the stars always make me laugh\", \"' And they will think you are crazy\", 'It will be a very shabby trick that I shall have played on you', '\"And he laughed again', '\"It will be as if, in place of the stars, I had given you a great number of little bells that knew how to laugh', '\"And he laughed again', 'Then he quickly became serious: \"Tonight, you know', 'do not come,\" said the little prince', '\"I shall not leave you,\" I said', '\"I shall look as if I were suffering', 'I shall look a little as if I were dying', 'It is like that', 'Do not come to see that', 'It is not worth the trouble', '\"\"I shall not leave you', '\"But he was worried', '\"I tell you, it is also because of the snake', 'He must not bite you', 'Snakes, they are malicious creatures', 'This one might bite you just for fun', '\"\"I shall not leave you', '\"But a thought came to reassure him: \"It is true that they have no more poison for a second bite', '\"That night I did not see him set out on his way', 'He got away from me without making a sound', 'When I succeeded in catching up with him he was walking along with a quick and resolute step', 'He said to me merely: \"Ah', 'You are there', '\" And he took me by the hand', 'But he was still worrying', '\"It was wrong of you to come', 'You will suffer', 'I shall look as if I were dead; and that will not be true', '\"I said nothing', '\"You understand', 'it is too far', 'I cannot carry this body with me', 'It is too heavy', '\"I said nothing', '\"But it will be like an old abandoned shell', 'There is nothing sad about old shells', '\"I said nothing', 'He was a little discouraged', 'But he made one more effort: \"You know, it will be very nice', 'I, too, shall look at the stars', 'All the stars will be wells with a rusty pulley', 'All the stars will pour out fresh water for me to drink', '\"I said nothing', '\"That will be so amusing', 'You will have five hundred million little bells, and I shall have five hundred million springs of fresh water', '\" And he too said nothing more, becuase he was crying', '\"Here it is', 'Let me go on by myself', '\" And he sat down, because he was afraid', 'Then he said, again: \"You know my flower', 'I am responsible for

kind of ogres, and with Princesses who work magic spells,and with Peris, who are Arab fairies', 'Sindbad had adventures whichperhaps came out of the Odyssey of Homer; in fact, all the Easthad

about four hundred years, from Persia to the bordersof China, beyond the great river Ganges itself, we read the praisesof one of the kings of this race, who was said to be the bestmonarch of his time', 'His subjects loved him, and his neighborsfeared him, and when he died he left his kingdom in a more prosperousand powerful condition than any king had done before him', 'The two sons who survived him loved each other tenderly, and it wasa real grief to the elder, Schahriar, that the laws of the empireforbade him to share his dominions with his brother Schahzeman', 'Indeed, after ten years, during which this state of things hadnot ceased to trouble him, Schahriar cut off the country of GreatTartary from the Persian Empire and made his brother king', 'Now the Sultan Schahriar had a wife whom he loved more than all the world,and his greatest happiness was to surround her with splendour,and to give her the infest dresses and the most beautiful jewels', 'It was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that heaccidentally discovered, after several years, that she had deceivedhim completely, and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad,that he felt himself obliged to carry out the law of the land,and order the grand-vizir to put her to death', 'The blow was soheavy that his mind almost gave way, and he declared that he wasquite sure that at bottom all women were as wicked as the sultana,if you could only find them out, and that the fewer the worldcontained the better', 'So every evening he married a fresh wifeand had her strangled the following morning before the grand-vizir,whose duty it was to provide these unhappy brides for the Sultan', 'The poor man fulfilled his task with reluctance, but there wasno escape, and every day saw a girl married and a wife dead', 'This behaviour caused the greatest horror in the town, where nothingwas heard but cries and lamentations', \"In one house was a father weepingfor the loss of his daughter, in another perhaps a mother tremblingfor the fate of her child; and instead of the blessings that hadformerly been heaped on the Sultan's head, the air was now full of curses\", 'The grand-vizir himself was the father of two daughters, of whomthe elder was called Scheherazade, and the younger Dinarzade', 'Dinarzade had no particular gifts to distinguish her from other girls,but her sister was clever and courageous in the highest degree', 'Her father had given her the best masters in philosophy, medicine,history and the fine arts, and besides all this, her beauty excelledthat of any girl in the kingdom of Persia', 'One day, when the grand-vizir was talking to his eldest daughter,who was his delight and pride, Scheherazade said to him, \"Father, Ihave a favour to ask of you', 'Will you grant it to me', '\"\"I can refuse you nothing,\" replied he, \"that is just and reasonable', '\"\"Then listen,\" said Scheherazade', '\"I am determined to stop thisbarbarous practice of the Sultan\\'s, and to deliver the girlsand mothers from the awful fate that hangs over them', '\"\"It would be an excellent thing to do,\" returned the grand-vizir,\"but how do you propose to accomplish it', '\"\"My father,\" answered Scheherazade, \"it is you who have to providethe Sultan daily with a fresh wife, and I implore you, by allthe affection you bear me, to allow the honour to fall upon me', '\"\"Have you lost your senses', '\" cried the grand-vizir, starting backin horror', '\"What has put such a thing into your head', \"You oughtto know by this time what it means to be the sultan's bride\", '\"\"Yes, my father, I know it well,\" replied she, \"and I am not afraidto think of it', 'If I fail, my death will be a glorious one,and if I succeed I shall have done a great service to my country', '\"\"It is of no use,\" said the grand-vizir, \"I shall never consent', 'If the Sultan was to order me to plunge a dagger in your heart,I should have to obey', 'What a task for a father', 'Ah, if you do notfear death, fear at any rate the anguish you would cause me', '\"\"Once again, my father,\" said Scheherazade, \"will you grant mewhat I ask', '\"\"What, are you still so obstinate', '\" exclaimed the grand-vizir', '\"Whyare you so resolved upon your own ruin', '\"But the maiden absolutely refused to attend to her father\\'s words,and at length, in despair, the grand-vizir was obliged to give way,and went sadly to the palace to tell the Sultan that the followingevening he would bring him Scheherazade', 'The Sultan received this news with the greatest astonishment', '\"How have you made up your mind,\" he asked, \"to sacrifice your owndaughter to me', '\"\"Sire,\" answered the grand-vizir, \"it is her own wish', 'Even the sadfate that awaits her could not hold her back', '\"\"Let there be no mistake, vizir,\" said the Sultan', '\"Remember youwill have to take her life yourself', 'If you refuse, I swearthat your head shall pay forfeit', '\"\"Sire,\" returned the vizir', '\"Whatever the cost, I will obey you', 'Though a father, I am also your subject', '\"  So the Sultan told thegrand-vizir he might bring his daughter as soon as he liked', 'The vizir took back this news to Scheherazade, who receivedit as if it had been the most pleasant thing in the world', 'She thanked her father warmly for yielding to her wishes, and,seeing him still bowed down with grief, told him that she hopedhe would never repent having allowed her to marry the Sultan', 'Then she went to prepare herself for the marriage, and beggedthat her sister Dinarzade should be sent for to speak to her', 'When they were alone, Scheherazade addressed her thus:\"My dear sister; I want your help in a very important affair', 'My father is going to take me to the palace to celebrate my marriagewith the Sultan', 'When his Highness receives me, I shall beg him,as a last favour, to let you sleep in our chamber, so that I mayhave your company during the last night I am alive', 'If, as I hope,he grants me my wish, be sure that you wake me an hour beforethe dawn, and speak to me in these words:  \"My sister, if you arenot asleep, I beg you, before the sun rises, to tell me one of yourcharming stories', '\"  Then I shall begin, and I hope by this meansto deliver the people from the terror that reigns over them', '\" Dinarzade replied that she would do with pleasure what hersister wished', 'When the usual hour arrived the grand-vizir conducted Scheherazadeto the palace, and left her alone with the Sultan, who bade her raiseher veil and was amazed at her beauty', 'But seeing her eyes fullof tears, he asked what was the matter', '\"Sire,\" replied Scheherazade,\"I have a sister who loves me as tenderly as I love her', 'Grant methe favour of allowing her to sleep this night in the same room,as it is the last we shall be together', '\"  Schahriar consentedto Scheherazade\\'s petition and Dinarzade was sent for', 'An hour before daybreak Dinarzade awoke, and exclaimed, as shehad promised, \"My dear sister, if you are not asleep, tell me Ipray you, before the sun rises, one of your charming stories', 'It is the last time that I shall have the pleasure of hearing you', '\"Scheherazade did not answer her sister, but turned to the Sultan', '\"Will your highness permit me to do as my sister asks', '\" said she', '\"Willingly,\" he answered', 'So Scheherazade began', 'The Story of the Merchant and the GeniusSire, there was once upon a time a merchant who possessed great wealth,in land and merchandise, as well as in ready money', 'He was obligedfrom time to time to take journeys to arrange his affairs', 'One day, having to go a long way from home, he mounted his horse,taking with him a small wallet in which he had put a few biscuitsand dates, because he had to pass through the desert where no foodwas to be got', 'He arrived without any mishap, and, having finishedhis business, set out on his return', 'On the fourth day of his journey,the heat of the sun being very great, he turned out of his roadto rest under some trees', 'He found at the foot of a largewalnut-tree a fountain of clear and running water', 'He dismounted,fastened his horse to a branch of the tree, and sat by the fountain,after having taken from his wallet some of his dates and biscuits', 'When he had finished this frugal mean he washed his face and handsin the fountain', 'When he was thus employed he saw an enormous genius, white with rage,coming towards him, with a scimitar in his hand', '\"Arise,\" he cried in a terrible voice, \"and let me kill you as youhave killed my son', '\"As he uttered these words he gave a frightful yell', 'The merchant,quite as much terrified at the hideous face of the monster as athis words, answered him tremblingly, \"Alas, good sir, what can Ihave done to you to deserve death', '\"\"I shall kill you,\" repeated the genius, \"as you have killed my son', '\"\"But,\" said the merchant, \"How can I have killed your son', 'I do not know him, and I have never even seen him', '\"\"When you arrived here did you not sit down on the ground', '\"asked the genius, \"and did you not take some dates from your wallet,and whilst eating them did not you throw the stones about', '\"\"Yes,\" said the merchant, \"I certainly did so', '\"\"Then,\" said the genius, \"I tell you you have killed my son,for whilst you were throwing about the stones, my son passed by,and one of them struck him in the eye and killed him', 'So I shallkill you', '\"\"Ah, sir, forgive me', '\" cried the merchant', '\"I will have no mercy on you,\" answered the genius', '\"But I killed your son quite unintentionally, so I implore youto spare my life', '\"\"No,\" said the genius, \"I shall kill you as you killed my son,\"and so saying, he seized the merchant by the arm, threw him onthe ground, and lifted his sabre to cut off his head', 'The merchant, protesting his innocence, bewailed his wifeand children, and tried pitifully to avert his fate', 'The genius,with his raised scimitar, waited till he had finished, bit wasnot in the least touched', 'Scheherazade, at this point, seeing that it was day, and knowingthat the Sultan always rose very early to attend the council,stopped speaking', '\"Indeed, sister,\" said Dinarzade, \"this is a wonderful story', '\"\"The rest is still more wonderful,\" replied Scheherazade, \"and youwould say so, if the sultan would allow me to live another day,and would give me leave to tell it to you the next night', '\"Schahriar, who had been listening to Scheherazade with pleasure,said to himself, \"I will wait till to-morrow; I can always have herkilled when I have heard the end of her story', '\"all this time the grand-vizir was in a terrible state of anxiety', 'But he was much delighted when he saw the Sultan enter the council-chamberwithout giving the terrible command that he was expecting', 'The next morning, before the day broke, Dinarzade said to her sister,\"Dear sister, if you are awake I pray you to go on with your story', '\"The Sultan did not wait for Scheherazade to ask his leave', '\"Finish,\" said he, \"the story of the genius and the merchant', 'I am curious to hear the end', '\"So Scheherazade went on with the story', 'This happened every morning', 'The Sultana told a story, and the Sultan let her live to finish it', 'When the merchant saw that the genius was determined to cut off his head,he said:  \"One word more, I entreat you', 'Grant me a little delay;just a short time to go home and bid my wife and children farewell,and to make my will', 'When I have done this I will come back here,and you shall kill me', '\"\"But,\" said the genius, \"if I grant you the delay you ask, I amafraid that you will not come back', '\"\"I give you my word of honour,\" answered the merchant, \"that Iwill come back without fail', '\"\"How long do you require', '\" asked the genius', '\"I ask you for a year\\'s grace,\" replied the merchant', '\"I promiseyou that to-morrow twelvemonth, I shall be waiting under these treesto give myself up to you', '\"On this the genius left him near the fountain and disappeared', 'The merchant, having recovered from his fright, mounted his horseand went on his road', 'When he arrived home his wife and children received him with thegreatest joy', 'But instead of embracing them he began to weep sobitterly that they soon guessed that something terrible was the matter', '\"Tell us, I pray you,\" said his wife, \"what has happened', '\"\"Alas', '\" answered her husband, \"I have only a year to live', '\"Then he told them what had passed between him and the genius,and how he had given his word to return at the end of a yearto be killed', 'When they heard this sad news they were in despair,and wept much', 'The next day the merchant began to settle his affairs, and firstof all to pay his debts', 'He gave presents to his friends,and large alms to the poor', 'He set his slaves at liberty,and provided for his wife and children', 'The year soon passed away,and he was obliged to depart', 'When he tried to say good-bye he wasquite overcome with grief, and with difficulty tore himself away', 'At length he reached the place where he had first seen the genius,on the very day that he had appointed', 'He dismounted, and satdown at the edge of the fountain, where he awaited the genius interrible suspense', 'Whilst he was thus waiting an old man leading a hind came towards him', 'They greeted one another, and then the old man said to him,\"May I ask, brother, what brought you to this desert place,where there are so many evil genii about', 'To see these beautifultress one would imagine it was inhabited, but it is a dangerousplace to stop long in', '\"The merchant told the old man why he was obliged to come there', 'He listened in astonishment', '\"This is a most marvellous affair', 'I should like to be a witness ofyour interview with the genius', '\"  So saying he sat down by the merchant', 'While they were talking another old man came up, followed by two blackdogs', 'He greeted them, and asked what they were doing in this place', 'The old man who was leading the hind told him the adventure of themerchant and the genius', 'The second old many had not sooner heardthe story than he, too, decided to stay there to see what would happen', 'He sat down by the others, and was talking, when a third oldman arrived', 'He asked why the merchant who was with them lookedso sad', 'They told him the story, and he also resolved to see whatwould pass between the genius and the merchant, so waited with the rest', 'They soon saw in the distance a thick smoke, like a cloud of dust', 'This smoke came nearer and nearer, and then, all at once,it vanished, and they saw the genius, who, without speaking to them,approached the merchant, sword in hand, and, taking him by the arm,said, \"Get up and let me kill you as you killed my son', '\"The merchant and the three old men began to weep and groan', 'Then the old man leading the hind threw himself at the monster\\'sfeet and said, \"O Prince of the Genii, I beg of you to stayyour fury and to listen to me', 'I am going to tell you my storyand that of the hind I have with me, and if you find it moremarvellous than that of the merchant whom you are about to kill,I hope that you will do away with a third part of his punishment', '\"The genius considered some time, and then he said, \"Very well,I agree to this', '\"The Story of the First Old Man and of the HindI am now going to begin my story (said the old man), so please attend', 'This hind that you see with me is my wife', 'We have no childrenof our own, therefore I adopted the son of a favorite slave,and determined to make him my heir', 'My wife, however, took a great dislike to both mother and child,which she concealed from me till too late', 'When my adoptedson was about ten years old I was obliged to go on a journey', \"Before I went I entrusted to my wife's keeping both the motherand child, and begged her to take care of them during my absence,which lasted a whole year\", 'During this time she studied magicin order to carry out her wicked scheme', 'When she had learnt enoughshe took my son into a distant place and changed him into a calf', 'Then she gave him to my steward, and told him to look after a calf shehad bought', 'She also changed the slave into a cow, which she sentto my steward', 'When I returned I inquired after my slave and the child', '\"Your slave is dead,\" she said, \"and as for your son, I havenot seen him for two months, and I do not know where he is', '\"I was grieved to hear of my slave\\'s death, but as my son had onlydisappeared, I thought I should soon find him', 'Eight months, however,passed, and still no tidings of him; then the feast of Bairam came', 'To celebrate it I ordered my steward to bring me a very fat cow tosacrifice', 'He did so', 'The cow that he brought was my unfortunate slave', 'I bound her, but just as I was about to kill her she began to lowmost piteously, and I saw that her eyes were streaming with tears', 'It seemed to me most extraordinary, and, feeling a movement of pity,I ordered the steward to lead her away and bring another', 'My wife,who was present, scoffed at my compassion, which made her maliceof no avail', '\"What are you doing', '\" she cried', '\"Kill this cow', 'It is the best we have to sacrifice', '\"To please her, I tried again, but again the animal\\'s lows and tearsdisarmed me', '\"Take her away,\" I said to the steward, \"and kill her; I cannot', '\"The steward killed her, but on skinning her found that she wasnothing but bones, although she appeared so fat', 'I was vexed', '\"Keep her for yourself,\" I said to the steward, \"and if you havea fat calf, bring that in her stead', '\"In a short time he brought a very fat calf, which, although I didnot know it, was my son', 'It tried hard to break its cord and cometo me', 'It threw itself at my feet, with its head on the ground,as if it wished to excite my pity, and to beg me not to take awayits life', 'I was even more surprised and touched at this action than I hadbeen at the tears of the cow', '\"Go,\" I said to the steward, \"take back this calf, take great careof it, and bring me another in its place instantly', '\"As soon as my wife heard me speak this she at once cried out,\"What are you doing, husband', 'Do not sacrifice any calf but this', '\"\"Wife,\" I answered, \"I will not sacrifice this calf,\" and in spiteof all her remonstrances, I remained firm', 'I had another calf killed; this one was led away', 'The next daythe steward asked to speak to me in private', '\"I have come,\" he said, \"to tell you some news which I think you willlike to hear', 'I have a daughter who knows magic', 'Yesterday, when Iwas leading back the calf which you refused to sacrifice, I noticedthat she smiled, and then directly afterwards began to cry', 'I asked her why she did so', '\"\"Father,\" she answered, \"this calf is the son of our master', 'I smile with joy at seeing him still alive, and I weep to thinkof his mother, who was sacrificed yesterday as a cow', \"These changeshave been wrought by our master's wife, who hated the motherand son\", '\"\"At these words, of Genius,\" continued the old man, \"I leave youto imagine my astonishment', 'I went immediately with the stewardto speak with his daughter myself', 'First of all I went to the stableto see my son, and he replied in his dumb way to all my caresses', \"When the steward's daughter came I asked her if she could change myson back to his proper shape\", '\"\"Yes, I can,\" she replied, \"on two conditions', 'One is that youwill give him me for a husband, and the other is that you will letme punish the woman who changed him into a calf', '\"\"To the first condition,\" I answered, \"I agree with all my heart,and I will give you an ample dowry', 'To the second I also agree,I only beg you to spare her life', '\"\"That I will do,\" she replied; \"I will treat her as she treatedyour son', '\"Then she took a vessel of water and pronounced over it some wordsI did not understand; then, on throwing the water over him,he

out of gratitude you will marry her', '\"He consented joyfully, but before they were married, the young girlchanged my wife into a hind, and it is she whom you see before you', 'I wished her to have this form rather than a stranger one, so that wecould see her in the family without repugnance', 'Since then my son has become a widower and has gone travelling', 'I am now going in search of him, and not wishing to confide my wifeto the care of other people, I am taking herr with me', 'Is this nota most marvellous tale', '\"It is indeed,\" said the genius, \"and because of it I grant to youthe third part of the punishment of this merchant', '\"When the first old man had finished his story, the second,who was leading the two black dogs, said to the genius, \"I amgoing to tell you what

Second Old Man, and of the Two Black DogsGreat prince of the genii, you must know that we are three brothers--these two black dogs and myself', 'Our father died, leaving useach a thousand sequins', 'With this sum we all three took upthe same profession, and became merchants', 'A short time after wehad opened our shops, my eldest brother, one of these two dogs,resolved to travel in foreign countries for the sake of merchandise', 'With this intention he sold all he had and bought merchandise suitableto the voyages he was about to make', 'He set out, and was awaya whole year', 'At the end of this time a beggar came to my shop', '\"Good-day,\" I said', '\"Good-day,\" he answered; \"is it possible thatyou do not recognise me', '\"  Then I looked at him closely and saw hewas my brother', 'I made him come into my house, and asked him how hehad fared in his enterprise', '\"Do not question me,\" he replied, \"see me, you see all I have', 'It would but renew my trouble to tell of all the misfortunes thathave befallen me in a year, and have brought me to this state', '\"I shut up my shop, paid him every attention, taking him to the bath,giving him my most beautiful robes', 'I examined my accounts, and foundthat I had doubled my capital--that is, that I now possessed twothousand sequins', 'I gave my brother half, saying:  \"Now, brother,you can forget your losses', '\"  He accepted them with joy, and welived together as we had before', 'Some time afterwards my second brother wished also to sell his businessand travel', 'My eldest brother and I did all we could to dissuade him,but it was of no use', 'He joined a caravan and set out', 'He cameback at the end of a year in the same state as his elder brother', 'I took care of him, and as I had a thousand sequins to spare I gavethem to him, and he re-opened his shop', 'One day, my two brothers came to me to propose that we should makea journey and trade', 'At first I refused to go', '\"You travelled,\"I said, \"and what did you gain', '\"  But they came to me repeatedly,and after having held out for five years I at last gave way', 'But when they had made their preparation, and they began to buythe merchandise we needed, they found they had spent every pieceof the thousand sequins I had given them', 'I did not reproach them', 'I divided my six thousand sequins with them, giving a thousand to eachand keeping one for myself, and the other three I buried in a cornerof my house', 'We bought merchandise, loaded a vessel with it, and setforth with a favorable wind', \"After two months' sailing we arrived at a seaport, where wedisembarked and did a great trade\", 'Then we bought the merchandiseof the country, and were just going to sail once more, when I wasstopped on the shore by a beautiful though poorly dressed woman', 'She came up to me, kissed my hand, and implored me to marry her,and take her on board', 'At first I refused, but she begged so hardand promised to be such a good wife to me, that at last I consented', 'I got her some beautiful dresses, and after having married her,we embarked and set sail', 'During the voyage, I discovered so manygood qualities in my wife that I began to lover her more and more', 'But my brothers began to be jealous of my prosperity, and set to workto plot against my life', 'One night when we were sleeping they threwmy wife and myself into the sea', 'My wife, however, was a fairy,and so she did not let me drown, but transported me to an island', 'When the day dawned, she said to me,\"When I saw you on the sea-shore I took a great fancy to you,and wished to try your good nature, so I presented myself in thedisguise you saw', 'Now I have rewarded you by saving your life', 'But I am very angry with your brothers, and I shall not rest till Ihave taken their lives', '\"I thanked the fairy for all that she had done for me, but I beggedher not to kill my brothers', 'I appeased her wrath, and in a moment she transported me fromthe island where we were to the roof of my house, and shedisappeared a moment afterwards', 'I went down, and opened the doors,and dug up the three thousand sequins which I had buried', 'I wentto the place where my shop was, opened it, and received from myfellow-merchants congratulations on my return', 'When I went home,I saw two black dogs who came to meet me with sorrowful faces', 'I was much astonished, but the fairy who reappeared said to me,\"Do not be surprised to see these dogs; they are your two brothers', 'I have condemned them to remain for ten years in these shapes', '\" Then having told me where I could hear news of her, she vanished', 'The ten years are nearly passed, and I am on the road to find her', 'As in passing I met this merchant and the old man with the hind,I stayed with them', 'This is my history, O prince of genii', 'Do you not think itis a most marvellous one', '\"Yes, indeed,\" replied the genius, \"and I will give up to youthe third of the merchant\\'s punishment', '\"Then the third old man made the genius the same request as theother two had done, and the genius promised him the last thirdof the merchant\\'s punishment if his story surpassed both the others', 'So he told his story to the genius, but I cannot tell you what it was,as I do not know', 'But I do know that it was even more marvellous than either of the others,so that the genius was astonished, and said to the third old man,\"I will give up to you the third part of the merchant\\'s punishment', 'He ought to thank all three of you for having interested yourselvesin his favour', 'But for you, he would be here no longer', '\"so saying, he disappeared, to the great joy of the company', 'The merchant did not fail to thank his friends, and then each wenton his way', 'The merchant returned to his wife and children,and passed the rest of his days happily with them', '\"But, sire,\" added Scheherazade, \"however beautiful are the stories Ihave just told you, they cannot compare with the story of the Fisherman', '\"The Story of the FishermanSire, there was once upon a time a fisherman so old and so poor thathe could scarcely manage to support his wife and three children', 'He went every day to fish very early, and each day he made a rule notto throw his nets more than four times', 'He started out one morningby moonlight and came to the sea-shore', 'He undressed and threw his nets,and as he was drawing them towards the bank he felt a great weight', 'He though he had caught a large fish, and he felt very pleased', 'But a moment afterwards, seeing that instead of a fish he only had inhis nets the carcase of an ass, he was much disappointed', 'Vexed with having such a bad haul, when he had mended his nets,which the carcase of the ass had broken in several places, he threwthem a second time', 'In drawing them in he again felt a great weight,so that he thought they were full of fish', 'But he only found a largebasket full of rubbish', 'He was much annoyed', '\"O Fortune,\" he cried, \"do not trifle thus with me, a poor fisherman,who can hardly support his family', '\"So saying, he threw away the rubbish, and after having washed hisnets clean of the dirt, he threw them for the third time', 'But heonly drew in stones, shells, and mud', 'He was almost in despair', 'Then he threw his nets for the fourth time', 'When he thought he hada fish he drew them in with a great deal of trouble', 'There was nofish however, but he found a yellow pot, which by its weight seemedfull of something, and he noticed that it was fastened and sealedwith lead, with the impression of a seal', 'He was delighted', '\"I will sell it to the founder,\" he said; \"with the money I shallget for it I shall buy a measure of wheat', '\"He examined the jar on all sides; he shook it to see if it would rattle', 'But he heard nothing, and so, judging from the impression of the sealand the lid, he thought there must be something precious inside', 'To find out, he took his knife, and with a little trouble he opened it', 'He turned it upside down, but nothing came out, which surprisedhim very much', 'He set it in front of him, and whilst he waslooking at it attentively, such a thick smoke came out that hehad to step back a pace or two', 'This smoke rose up to the clouds,and stretching over the sea and the shore, formed a thick mist,which caused the fisherman much astonishment', 'When all the smokewas out of the jar it gathered itself together, and became a thickmass in which appeared a genius, twice as large as the largest giant', 'When he saw such a terrible-looking monster, the fisherman wouldlike to have run away, but he trembled so with fright that he couldnot move a step', '\"Great king of the genii,\" cried the monster, \"I will never againdisobey you', '\"At these words the fisherman took courage', '\"What is this you are saying, great genius', 'Tell me your historyand how you came to be shut up in that vase', '\"At this, the genius looked at the fisherman haughtily', '\"speak to memore civilly,\" he said, \"before I kill you', '\"\"Alas', 'why should you kill me', '\" cried the fisherman', '\"I have justfreed you; have you already forgotten that', '\"\"No,\" answered the genius; \"but that will not prevent me fromkilling you; and I am only going to grant you one favour,and that is to choose the manner of your death', '\"\"But what have I don to you', '\" asked the fisherman', '\"I cannot treat you in any other way,\" said the genius, \"and if youwould know why, listen to my story', '\"\"I rebelled against the king of the genii', 'To punish me, he shutme up in this vase of copper, and he put on the leaden coverhis seal, which is enchantment enough to prevent my coming out', 'Then he had the vase thrown into the sea', 'During the first periodof my captivity I vowed that if anyone should free me before a hundredyears were passed, I would make him rich even after his death', 'But that century passed, and no one freed me', 'In the second century Ivowed that I would give all the treasures in the world to my deliverer;but he never came', '\"\"In the third, I promised to make him a king, to be always near him,and to grant him three wishes every day; but that century passedaway as the other two had done, and I remained in the same plight', 'At last I grew angry at being captive for so long, and I vowedthat if anyone would release me I would kill him at once,and would only allow him to choose in what manner he should die', 'So you see, as you have freed me to-day, choose in what way youwill die', '\"The fisherman was very unhappy', '\"What an unlucky man I am to havefreed you', 'I implore you to spare my life', '\"\"I have told you,\" said the genius, \"that it is impossible', 'Choose quickly; you are wasting time', '\"The fisherman began to devise a plot', '\"Since I must die,\" he said, \"before I choose the manner of my death,I conjure you on your honour to tell me if you really were inthat vase', '\"\"Yes, I was\" answered the genius', '\"I really cannot believe it,\" said the fisherman', '\"That vase couldnot contain one of your feet even, and how could your whole bodygo in', 'I cannot believe it unless I see you do the thing', '\"Then the genius began to change himself into smoke, which, as before,spread over the sea and the shore, and which, then collectingitself together, began to go back into the vase slowly and evenlytill there was nothing left outside', 'Then a voice came from thevase which said to the fisherman, \"Well, unbelieving fisherman,here I am in the vase; do you believe me now', '\"The fisherman instead of answering took the lid of lead and shutit down quickly on the vase', '\"Now, O genius,\" he cried, \"ask pardon of me, and choose by what deathyou will die', 'But no, it will be better if I throw you into the seawhence I drew you out, and I will build a house on the shore to warnfishermen who come to cast their nets here, against fishing up sucha wicked genius as you are, who vows to kill the man who frees you', '\"At these words the genius did all he could to get out, but hecould not, because of the enchantment of the lid', 'Then he tried to get out by cunning', '\"If you will take off the cover,\" he said, \"I will repay you', '\"\"No,\" answered the fisherman, \"if I trust myself to you Iam afraid you will treat me as a certain Greek king treatedthe physician Douban', 'Listen, and I will tell you', '\"The Story of the Greek King and the Physician DoubanIn the country of Zouman, in Persia, there lived a Greek king', 'This kin was a leper, and all his doctors had been unable to cure him,when a very clever physician came to his court', 'He was very learned in all languages, and knew a great deal aboutherbs and medicines', \"As soon as he was told of the king's illness he put on his bestrobe and presented himself before the king\", '\"Sire,\" said he,\"I know that no physician has been able to cure your majesty,but if you will follow my instructions, I will promise to cure youwithout any medicines or outward application', '\"The king listened to this proposal', '\"If you are clever enough to do this,\" he said, \"I promise to makeyou and your descendants rich for ever', '\"The physician went to his house and made a polo club, the handleof which he hollowed out, and put in it the drug he wished to use', 'Then he made a ball, and with these things he went the next day tothe king', 'He told him that he wished him to play at polo', 'Accordingly theking mounted his horse and went into the place where he played', 'There the physician approached him with the bat he had made, saying,\"Take this, sire, and strike the ball till you feel your hand and wholebody in a glow', 'When the remedy that is in the handle of the clubis warmed by your hand it will penetrate throughout your body', 'The you must return to your palace, bathe, and go to sleep,and when you awake to-morrow morning you will be cured', '\"The king took the club and urged his horse after the ball which hehad thrown', 'He struck it, and then it was hit back by the courtierswho were playing with him', 'When he felt very hot he stopped playing,and went back to the palace, went into the bath, and did all thatthe physician had said', 'The next day when he arose he found,to his great joy and astonishment, that he was completely cured', 'When he entered his audience-chamber all his courtiers, who wereeager to see if the wonderful cure had been effected, were overwhelmedwith joy', 'The physician Douban entered the hall and bowed low to the ground', 'The king, seeing him, called him, made him sit by his side, and showedhim every mark of honour', 'That evening he gave him a long and rich robe of state, and presentedhim with two thousand sequins', 'The following day he continuedto load him with favours', 'Now the king had a grand-vizir who was avaricious, and envious,and a very bad man', 'He grew extremely jealous of the physician,and determined to bring about his ruin', 'In order to do this he asked to speak in private with the king,saying that he had a most important communication to make', '\"What is it', '\" asked the king', '\"Sire,\" answered the grand-vizir, \"it is most dangerous for a monarchto confide in a man whose faithfulness is not proved, You do not knowthat this physician is not a traitor come here to assassinate you', '\"\"I am sure,\" said the king, \"that this man is the most faithful andvirtuous of men', 'If he wished to take my life, why did he cure me', 'Cease to speak against him I see what it is, you are jealous of him;but do not think that I can be turned against him', 'I remember wellwhat a vizir said to King Sindbad, his master, to prevent him fromputting the prince, his son, to death', '\"What the Greek king said excited the vizir\\'s curiosity, and hesaid to him, \"Sire, I beg your majesty to have the condescensionto tell me what the vizir said to King Sindbad', '\"\"This vizir,\" he replied, \"told King Sindbad that one ought notbelieve everything that a mother-in-law says, and told him this story', '\"The Story of the Husband and the ParrotA good man had a beautiful wife, whom he loved passionately, and neverleft if possible', 'One day, when he was obliged by important businessto go away from her, he went to a place where all kinds of birdsare sold and bought a parrot', 'This parrot not only spoke well,but it had the gift of telling all that had been done before it', 'He brought it home in a cage, and asked his wife to put it in her room,and take great care of it while he was away', 'Then he departed', 'On his return he asked the parrot what had happened during his absence,and the parrot told him some things which made him scold his wife', 'She thought that one of her slaves must have been telling tales of her,but they told her it was the parrot, and she resolved to revengeherself on him', \"When her husband next went away for one day, she told on slaveto turn under the bird's cage a hand-mill; another to throw waterdown from above the cage, and a third to take a mirror and turn itin front of its eyes, from left to right by the light of a candle\", 'The slaves did this for part of the night, and did it very well', 'The next day when the husband came back he asked the parrot whathe had seen', 'The bird replied, \"My good master, the lightning,thunder and rain disturbed me so much all night long, that I cannottell you what I have suffered', '\"The husband, who knew that it had neither rained nor thundered inthe night, was convinced that the parrot was not speaking the truth,so he took him out of the cage and threw him so roughly on theground that he killed him', 'Nevertheless he was sorry afterwards,for he found that the parrot had spoken the truth', '\"When the Greek king,\" said the fisherman to the genius,\"had finished the story of the parrot, he added to the vizir,\"And so, vizir, I shall not listen to you, and I shall takecare of the physician, in case I repent as the husband didwhen he had killed the parrot', '\"  But the vizir was determined', '\"Sire,\" he replied, \"the death of the parrot was nothing', 'But when it is a question of the life of a king it is better tosacrifice the innocent than save the guilty', 'It is no uncertainthing, however', 'The physician, Douban, wishes to assassinate you', 'My zeal prompts me to disclose this to your Majesty', 'If I am wrong,I deserve to be punished as a vizir was once punished', '\"  \"What hadthe vizir done,\" said the Greek king, \"to merit the punishment', '\" \"I will tell your Majesty, if you will do me the honour to listen,\"answered the vizir', '\"The Story of the Vizir Who Was PunishedThere was once upon a time a king who had a son who was very fondof hunting', 'He often allowed him to indulge in this pastime,but he had ordered his grand-vizir always to go with him,and never to lose sight of him', 'One day the huntsman roused a stag,and the prince, thinking that the vizir was behind, gave chase,and rode so hard that he found himself alone', 'He stopped,and having lost sight of it, he turned to rejoin the vizir,who had not been careful enough to follow him', 'But he lost his way', 'Whilst he was trying to find it, he saw on the side of the roada beautiful lady who was crying bitterly', \"He drew his horse's rein,and asked her who she was and what she was doing in this place,and if she needed help\", '\"I am the daughter of an Indian king,\"she answered, \"and whilst riding in the country I fell asleep andtumbled off', 'My horse has run away, and I do not know what has becomeof him', '\"The young prince had pity on her, and offered to take her behind him,which he did', 'As they passed by a ruined building the lady dismountedand went in', 'The prince also dismounted and followed her', 'To his great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside,\"Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth', '\"  And othervoices replied, \"Where is he, mamma, that we may eat him at once,as we are very hungry', '\"The prince at once saw the danger he was in', 'He now knew that thelady who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an ogress,who lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles surprisedand devoured passers-by', 'He was terrified, and threw himself onhis horse', 'The pretended princess appeared at this moment, and seeingthat she had lost her prey, she said to him, \"Do not be afraid', 'What do you want', '\"\"I am lost,\" he answered, \"and I am looking for the road', '\"\"Keep straight on,\" said the ogress, \"and you will find it', '\"The prince could hardly believe his ears, and rode off as hardas he could', \"He found his way, and arrived safe and sound athis father's house, where he told him of the danger he had runbecause of the grand-vizir's carelessness\", 'The king was very angry,and had him strangled immediately', '\"Sire,\" went on the vizir to the Greek king, \"to return tothe physician, Douban', 'If you do not take care, you will repentof having trusted him', 'Who knows what this remedy, with whichhe has cured you, may not in time have a bad effect on you', '\"The Greek king was naturally very weak, and did not perceivethe wicked intention of his vizir, nor was he firm enough to keepto his first resolution', '\"Well, vizir,\" he said, \"you are right', 'Perhaps he did come to takemy life', 'Me might do it by the mere smell of one of his drugs', 'I must see what can be done', '\"\"The best means, sire, to put your life in security, is to sendfor him at once, and to cut off his head directly he comes,\"said the vizir', '\"I really think,\" replied the king, \"that will be the best way', '\"He then ordered one of his ministers to fetch the physician,who came at once', '\"I have had you sent for,\" said the king, \"in order to free myselffrom you by taking your life', '\"The physician was beyond measure astonished when he heard he wasto die', '\"What crimes have I committed, your majesty', '\"\"I have learnt,\" replied the king, \"that you are a spy, and intendto kill me', 'But I will be first, and kill you', 'Strike,\" he addedto an executioner who was by, \"and rid me of this assassin', '\"At this cruel order the physician threw himself on his knees', '\"Spare my life,\" he cried, \"and yours will be spared', '\"The fisherman stopped here to say to the genius:  \"You see whatpassed between the Greek king and the physician has just passedbetween us two', 'The Greek king,\" he went on, \"had no mercy on him,and the executioner bound his eyes', '\"All those present begged for his life, but in vain', 'The physician on his knees, and bound, said to the king: \"At least let me put my affairs in order, and leave my booksto persons who will make good use of them', 'There is one which Ishould like to present to your majesty', 'It is very precious,and ought to be kept carefully in your treasury', 'It containsmany curious things the chief being that when you cut off my head,if your majesty will turn to the sixth leaf, and read the thirdline of the left-hand page, my head will answer all the questionsyou like to ask it', '\"The kin, eager to see such a wonderful thing, put off his executionto the next day, and sent him under a strong guard to his house', 'There the physician put his affairs in order, and the next daythere was a great crowd assembled in the hall to see his death,and the doings after it', 'The physician went up to the footof the throne with a large book in his hand', 'He carried a basin,on which he spread the covering of the book, and presenting it tothe king, said:  \"Sire, take this book, and when my head is cut off,let it be placed in the basin on the covering of this book; as soonas it is there, the blood will cease to flow', 'Then open the book,and my head will answer your questions', 'But, sire, I implore your mercy,for I am innocent', '\"\"Your prayers are useless, and if it were only to hear your headspeak when you are dead, you should die', '\"so saying, he took the book from the physician\\'s hands, and orderedthe executioner to do his duty', 'The head was so cleverly cut off that it fell into the basin,and directly the blood ceased to flow', 'Then, to the great astonishmentof the king, the eyes opened, and the head said, \"Your majesty,open the book', '\"  The king did so, and finding that the first leafstuck against the second, he put his finger in his mouth, to turn itmore easily', 'He did the same thing till he reached the sixth page,and not seeing any writing on it, \"Physician,\" he said, \"there isno writing', '\"\"Turn over a few more pages,\" answered the head', 'The king wenton turning, still putting his finger in his mouth, till the poisonin which each page was dipped took effect', 'His sight failed him,and he fell at the foot of his throne', 'When the physician\\'s head saw that the poison had taken effect,and that the king had only a few more minutes to live,\"Tyrant,\" it cried, \"see how cruelty and injustice are punished', '\"Scarcely had it uttered these words than the king died, and the headlost also the little life that had remained in it', 'That is the end of the story of the Greek king, and now let usreturn to the fisherman and the genius', '\"If the Greek king,\" said the fisherman, \"had spared the physician,he would not have thus died', 'The same thing applies to you', 'Now I am going to throw you into the sea', '\"\"My friend,\" said the genius, \"do not do such a cruel thing', 'Do not treat me as Imma treated Ateca', '\"\"What did Imma do to Ateca', '\" asked the fisherman', '\"Do you think I can tell you while I am shut up in here', '\"replied the genius', '\"Let me out, and I will make you rich', '\"The hope of being no longer poor made the fisherman give way', '\"If you will give me your promise to do this, I will open the lid', 'I do not think you will dare to break your word', '\"The genius promised, and the fisherman lifted the lid', 'He cameout at once in smoke, and then, having resumed his proper form,the first thing he did was to kick the vase into the sea', 'This frightened the fisherman, but the genius laughed and said,\"Do not be afraid; I only did it to frighten you, and to show youthat I intend to keep my word; take your nets and follow me', '\"He began to walk in front of the fisherman, who followed himwith some misgivings', 'They passed in front of the town, and wentup a mountain and then down into a great plain, where therewas a large lake lying between four hills', 'When they reached the lake the genius said to the fisherman,\"Throw your nets and catch fish', '\"The fisherman did as he was told, hoping for a good catch,as he saw plenty of fish', 'What was his astonishment at seeingthat there were four quite different kinds, some white, some red,some blue, and some yellow', 'He caught four, one of each colour', 'As he had never seen any like them he admired them very much,and he was very please to think how much money he would getfor them', '\"Take these fish and carry them to the Sultan, who will give you moremoney for them than you have ever had in your life', 'You can comeevery day to fish in this lake, but be careful not to throw your netsmore than once every day, otherwise some harm will happen to you', 'If you follow my advice carefully you will find it good', '\"Saying these words, he struck his foot against the ground,which opened, and when he had disappeared, it closed immediately', 'The fisherman resolved to obey the genius exactly, so he didnot cast his nets a second time, but walked into the town to sellhis fish at the palace', 'When the Sultan saw the fish he was much astonished', 'He looked atthem one after the other, and when he had admired them long enough,\"Take these fish,\" he said to his first vizir, \"and given themto the clever cook the Emperor of the Greeks sent me', 'I think theymust be as good as they are beautiful', '\"The vizir took them himself to the cook, saying, \"Here are four fishthat have been brought to the Sultan', 'He wants you to cook them', '\"Then he went back to the Sultan, who told him to give the fishermanfour hundred gold pieces', 'The fisherman, who had never beforepossessed such a large sum of money at once, could hardly believehis good fortune', 'He at once relieved the needs of his family,and made good use of it', 'But now we must return to the kitchen, which we shall findin great confusion', 'The cook, when she had cleaned the fish,put them in a pan with some oil to fry them', 'When she thoughtthem cooked enough on one side she turned them on the other', 'But scarcely had she done so when the walls of the kitchen opened,and there came out a young and beautiful damsel', 'She was dressedin an Egyptian dress of flowered satin, and she wore earrings,and a necklace of white pearls, and bracelets of gold set with rubies,and she held a wand of myrtle in her hand', 'She went up to the pan, to the great astonishment of the cook,who stood motionless at the sight of her', 'She struck one of the fishwith her rod, \"Fish, fish,\" said she, \"are you doing your duty', '\" The fish answered nothing, and then she repeated her question,whereupon they all raised their heads together and answeredvery distinctly, \"Yes, yes', 'If you reckon, we reckon', 'If youpay your debts, we pay ours', 'If you fly, we conquer, and weare content', '\"When they had spoken the girl upset the pan, and entered the openingin the wall, which at once closed, and appeared the same as before', 'When the cook had recovered from her fright she lifted up the fishwhich had fallen into the ashes, but she found them as black as cinders,and not fit to serve up to the Sultan', 'She began to cry', '\"Alas', 'what shall I say to the Sultan', 'He will be so angry with me,and I know he will not believe me', '\"Whilst she was crying the grand-vizir came in and askedif the fish were ready', 'She told him all that had happened,and he was much surprised', 'He sent at once for the fisherman,and when he came said to him, \"Fisherman, bring me fourmore fish like you have brought already, for an accidenthas happened to them so that they cannot be served up to the Sultan', '\"The fisherman did not say what the genius had told him, but heexcused himself from bringing them that day on account of the lengthof the way, and he promised to bring them next day', 'In the night he went to the lake, cast his nets, and on drawingthem in found four fish, which were like the others, each ofa different colour', 'He went back at once and carried them to the grand-vizir as hehad promised', 'He then took them to the kitchen and shut himself up with the cook,who began to cook them as she had done the four others on theprevious day', 'When she was about to turn them on the other side,the wall opened, the damsel appeared, addressed the same wordsto the fish, received the same answer, and then overturned the panand disappeared', 'The grand-vizir was filled with astonishment', '\"I shall tellthe Sultan all that has happened,\" said he', 'And he did so', 'The Sultan was very much astounded, and wished to see this marvelfor himself', 'So he sent for the fisherman, and asked him to procurefour more fish', 'The fisherman asked for three days, which were granted,and he then cast his nets in the lake, and again caught four differentcoloured fish', 'The sultan was delighted to see he had got them,and gave him again four hundred gold pieces', 'As soon as the Sultan had the fish he had them carried to his roomwith all that was needed to cook them', 'Then he shut himself up with the grand-vizir, who began to preparethem and cook them', 'When they were done on one side he turned themover on the other', 'Then the wall of the room opened, but insteadof the maiden a black slave came out', 'He was enormously tall,and carried a large green stick with which he touched the fish,saying in a terrible voice, \"Fish, fish, are you doing your duty', '\" To these words the fish lifting up their heads replied, \"Yes, yes', 'If you reckon, we reckon', 'If you pay your debts, we pay ours', 'If you fly, we conquer, and are content', '\"The black slave overturned the pan in the middle of the room,and the fish were turned to cinders', 'Then he stepped proudly backinto the wall, which closed round him', '\"After having seen this,\" said the Sultan, \"I cannot rest', 'These fish signify some mystery I must clear up', '\"He sent for the fisherman', '\"Fisherman,\" he said, \"the fish youhave brought us have caused me some anxiety', 'Where did you getthem from', '\"\"Sire,\" he answered, \"I got them from a lake which lies in themiddle of four hills beyond yonder mountains', '\"\"Do you know this lake', '\" asked the Sultan of the grand-vizir', '\"No; though I have hunted many times round that mountain, I havenever heard of it,\" said the vizir', \"As the fisherman said it was only three hours' journey away,the sultan ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither,and the fisherman led them\", 'They climbed the mountain, and then, on the other side, saw thelake as the fisherman had described', 'The water was so clearthat they could see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it', 'They looked at them for some time, and then the Sultan ordered themto make a camp by the edge of the water', 'When night came the Sultan called his vizir, and said to him,\"I have resolved to clear up this mystery', 'I am going out alone,and do you stay here in my tent, and when my ministers come to-morrow,say I am not well, and cannot see them', 'Do this each day tillI return', '\"The grand-vizir tried to persuade the Sultan not to go, but in vain', 'The Sultan took off his state robe and put on his sword, and when hesaw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone', 'He climbed one of the hills, and then crossed the great plain, till,just as the sun rose, he beheld far in front of him a large building', 'When he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace of beautifulblack polished marble, covered with steel as smooth as a mirror', 'He went to the gate, which stood half open, and went in, as nobodycame when he knocked', 'He passed through a magnificent courtyardand still saw no one, though he called aloud several times', 'He entered large halls where the carpets were of silk, the loungesand sofas covered with tapestry from Mecca, and the hangings of the mostbeautiful Indian stuffs of gold and silver', 'Then he found himselfin a splendid room, with a fountain supported by golden lions', \"The water out of the lions' mouths turned into diamonds and pearls,and the leaping water almost touched a most beautifully-painted dome\", 'The palace was surrounded on three sides by magnificent gardens,little lakes, and woods', 'Birds sang in the trees, which were nettedover to keep them always there', 'Still the Sultan saw no one, till he heard a plaintive cry,and a voice which said, \"Oh that I could die, for I am too unhappyto wish to live any longer', '\"The Sultan looked round to discover who it was who this bemoanedhis fate, and at last saw a handsome young man, richly clothed,who was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground', 'His face was very sad', 'The sultan approached him and bowed to him', 'The young man benthis head very low, but did not rise', '\"Sire,\" he said to the Sultan, \"I cannot rise and do youthe reverence that I am sure should be paid to your rank', '\"\"Sir,\" answered the Sultan, \"I am sure you have a good reasonfor not doing so, and having heard your cry of distress, I am cometo offer you my help', 'Whose is this palace, and why is it thus empty', '\"Instead of answering the young man lifted up his robe, and showedthe Sultan that, from the waist downwards, he was a block of black marble', 'The Sultan was horrified, and begged the young man to tell himhis story', '\"Willingly I will tell you my sad history,\" said the young man', 'The Story of the Young King of the Black IslesYou must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud, the king of thiscountry, the Black Isles, so called from the four little mountainswhich were once islands, while the capital was the place where nowthe great lake lies', 'My story will tell you how these changes came about', 'My father died when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him', 'I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she lovedme too', 'But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and was being fannedby two of her maids, I heard one say to the other, \"What a pity itis that our mistress no longer loves our master', 'I believe shewould like to kill him if she could, for she is an enchantress', '\"I soon found by watching that they were right, and when Imortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime,she begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where shewept and bewailed him for two years', 'At last I begged her to cease grieving for him, for although he couldnot speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him alive', 'She turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic words,and I instantly became as you see me now, half man and half marble', 'Then this wicked enchantress changed the capital, which wasa very populous and flourishing city, into the lake and desertplain you saw', 'The fish of four colours which are in it arethe different races who lived in the town; the four hills arethe four islands which give the name to my kingdom', 'All this theenchantress told me to add to my troubles', 'And this is not all', 'Every day she comes and beats me with a whip of buffalo hide', 'When the young king had finished his sad story he burst once moreinto tears, and the Sultan was much moved', '\"Tell me,\" he cried, \"where is this wicked woman, and where isthe miserable object of her affection, whom she just managesto keep alive', '\"\"Where she lives I do not know,\" answered the unhappy prince, \"but she goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet speakto her, after she has beaten me', '\"\"Unfortunate king,\" said the Sultan, \"I will do what I canto avenge you', '\"So he consulted with the young king over the best way to bringthis about, and they agreed their plan should be put in effectthe next day', 'The Sultan then rested, and the young king gavehimself up to happy hopes of release', 'The next day the Sultan arose,and then went to the palace in the garden where the black slave was', 'He drew his sword and destroyed the little life that remained in him,and then threw the body down a well', 'He then lay down on the couchwhere the slave had been, and waited for the enchantress', 'She went first to the young king, whom she beat with a hundred blows', 'Then she came to the room where she thought her wounded slave was,but where the Sultan really lay', 'She came near his couch and said, \"Are you better to-day,my dear slave', 'Speak but one word to me', '\"\"How can I be better,\" answered the Sultan, imitating the languageof the Ethiopians, \"when I can never sleep for the cries and groansof your husband', '\"\"What joy to hear you speak', '\" answered the queen', '\"Do you wishhim to regain his proper shape', '\"\"Yes,\" said the Sultan; \"hasten to set him at liberty, so that Imay no longer hear his cries', '\"The queen at once went out and took a cup of water, and saidover it some words that made it boil as if it were on the fire', 'Then she threw it over the prince, who at once regained his own form', 'He was filled with joy, but the enchantress said, \"Hasten away fromthis place and never come back, lest I kill you', '\"So he hid himself to see the end of the Sultan\\'s plan', 'The enchantress went back to the Palace of Tears and said,\"Now I have done what you wished', '\"\"What you have done,\" said the Sultan, \"is not enough to cure me', 'Every day at midnight all the people whom you have changed into fishlift their heads out of the lake and cry for vengeance', 'Go quickly,and give them their proper shape', '\"The enchantress hurried away and said some words over the lake', 'The fish then became men, women, and children, and the housesand shops were once more filled', \"The Sultan's suite, who hadencamped by the lake, were not a little astonished to see themselvesin the middle of a large and beautiful town\", 'As soon as she had disenchanted it the queen went back to the palace', '\"Are you quite well now', '\" she said', '\"Come near,\" said the Sultan', '\"Nearer still', '\"She obeyed', 'Then he sprang up, and with one blow of his sword hecut her in two', 'Then he went and found the prince', '\"Rejoice,\" he said, \"your cruel enemy is dead', '\"The prince thanked him again and again', '\"And now,\" said the Sultan', '\"I will go back to my capital,which I am glad to find is so near yours', '\"\"So near mine', '\" said the King of the Black Isles', '\"Do you know it is a whole year\\'s journey from here', 'You camehere in a few hours because it was enchanted', 'But I will accompanyyou on your journey', '\"\"It will give me much pleasure if you will escort me,\" said the Sultan,\"and as I have no children, I will make you my heir', '\"The Sultan and the prince set out together, the Sultan ladenwith rich presents from the King of the Black Isles', 'The day after he reached his capital the Sultan assembled his courtand told them all that had befallen him, and told them how heintended to adopt the young king as his heir', 'Then he gave each man presents in proportion to his rank', 'As for the fisherman, as he was the first cause of the deliveranceof the young prince, the Sultan gave him much money, and made himand his family happy for the rest of their days', 'Story of the Three Calenders, Sons of Kings, and of Five Ladiesof BagdadIn the reign of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived at Bagdada porter who, in spite of his humble calling, was an intelligentand sensible man', 'One morning he was sitting in his usual place withhis basket before him, waiting to be hired, when a tall young lady,covered with a long muslin veil, came up to him and said, \"Pick upyour basket and follow me', '\"  The porter, who was greatly pleasedby her appearance and voice, jumped up at once, poised his basketon his head, and accompanied the lady, saying to himself as he went,\"Oh, happy day', 'Oh, lucky meeting', '\"The lady soon stopped before a closed door, at which she knocked', 'It was opened by an old man with a long white beard, to whomthe lady held out money without speaking', 'The old man, who seemedto understand what she wanted, vanished into the house, and returnedbringing a large jar of wine, which the porter placed in his basket', 'Then the lady signed to him to follow, and they went their way', 'The next place she stopped at was a fruit and flower shop, and here shebought a large quantity of apples, apricots, peaches, and other things,with lilies, jasmine, and all sorts of sweet-smelling plants', 'From this shop she went to a butcher\\'s, a grocer\\'s, and a poulterer\\'s,till at last the porter exclaimed in despair, \"My good lady,if you had only told me you were going to buy enough provisionsto stock a town, I would have brought a horse, or rather a camel', '\" The lady laughed, and told him she had not finished yet, but afterchoosing various kinds of scents and spices from a druggist\\'s store,she halted before a magnificent palace, at the door of whichshe knocked gently', 'The porteress who opened it was of suchbeauty that the eyes of the man were quite dazzled, and he wasthe more astonished as he saw clearly that she was no slave', 'The lady who had led him hither stood watching him with amusement,till the porteress exclaimed, \"Why don\\'t you come in, my sister', 'This poor man is so heavily weighed down that he is ready to drop', '\"When they were both inside the door was fastened, and they allthree entered a large court, surrounded by an open-work gallery', 'At one end of the court was a platform, and on the platform stoodan amber throne supported by four ebony columns, garnished withpearls and diamonds', 'In the middle of the court stood a marblebasin filled with water from the mouth of a golden lion', 'The porter looked about him, noticing and admiring everything;but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sittingon the throne, who was even more beautiful than the other two', 'By the respect shown to her by the others, he judged that she must bethe eldest, and in this he was right', \"This lady's name was Zobeida,the porteress was Sadie, and the housekeeper was Amina\", 'At a wordfrom Zobeida, Sadie and Amina took the basket from the porter,who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight; and when itwas emptied, paid him handsomely for its use', 'But instead of takingup his basket and going away, the man still lingered, till Zobeidainquired what he was waiting for, and if he expected more money', '\"Oh, madam,\" returned he, \"you have already given me too much,and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking mydeparture at once', 'But, if you will pardon my saying so, I was lostin astonishment at seeing such beautiful ladies by them-selves', 'Acompany of women without men is, however, as dull as a company of menwithout women', '\"  And after telling some stories to prove his point,he ended by entreating them to let him stay and make a fourth attheir dinner', \"The ladies were rather amused at the man's assurances and aftersome discussion it was agreed that he should be allowed to stay,as his society might prove entertaining\", '\"But listen, friend,\"said Zobeida, \"if we grant your request, it is only on conditionthat you behave with the utmost politeness, and that you keep thesecret of our way of living, which chance has revealed to you', '\" Then they all sat down to table, which had been covered by Aminawith the dishes she had bought', 'After the first few mouthfuls Amina poured some wine into a golden cup', 'She first drank herself, according to the Arab custom, and thenfilled it for her sisters', \"When it came to the porter's turn hekissed Amina's hand, and sang a song, which he composed at the momentin praise of the wine\", 'The three ladies were pleased with the song,and then sang themselves, so that the repast was a merry one,and lasted much longer than usual', 'At length, seeing that the sun was about to set, Sadia saidto the porter, \"Rise and go; it is now time for us to separate', '\"\"Oh, madam,\" replied he, \"how can you desire me to quit you inthe state in which I am', 'Between the wine I have drunk, and thepleasure of seeing you, I should never find the way to my house', 'Let me remain here till morning, and when I have recovered my sensesI will go when you like', '\"\"Let him stay,\" said Amina, who had before proved herself his friend', '\"It is only just, as he has given us so much amusement', '\"\"If you wish it, my sister,\" replied Zobeida; \"but if he does,I must make a new condition', 'Porter,\" she continued, turning to him,\"if you remain, you must promise to ask no questions about anythingyou may see', \"If you do, you may perhaps hear what you don't like\", '\"This being settled, Amina brought in supper, and lit up the hall with anumber of sweet smelling tapers', 'They then sat down again at the table,and began with fresh appetites to eat, drink, sing, and recite verses', 'In fact, they were all enjoying themselves mightily when they hearda knock at the outer door, which Sadie rose to open', 'She soonreturned saying that three Calenders, all blind in the right eye,and all with their heads, faces, and eyebrows clean shaved,begged for admittance, as they were newly arrived in Bagdad,and night had already fallen', '\"They seem to have pleasant manners,\"she added, \"but you have no idea how funny they look', 'I am surewe should find their company diverting', '\"Zobeida and Amina made some difficulty about admitting the new comers,and Sadie knew the reason of their hesitation', 'But she urgedthe matter so strongly that Zobeida was at last forced to consent', '\"Bring them in, then,\" said she, \"but make them understand thatthey are not to make remarks about what does not concern them,and be sure to make them read the inscription over the door', '\" For on the door was written in letters of gold, \"Whoso meddles inaffairs that are no business of his, will hear truths that will notplease him', '\"The three Calenders bowed low on entering, and thanked the ladiesfor their kindness and hospitality', 'The ladies replied with wordsof welcome, and they were all about to seat themselves when the eyesof the Calenders fell on the porter, whose dress was not so very unliketheir own, though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him', '\"This,\" said one of them, \"is apparently one of our Arab brothers,who has rebelled against our ruler', '\"The porter, although half asleep from the wine he had drunk,heard the words, and without moving cried angrily to the Calender,\"Sit down and mind your own business', 'Did you not read the inscriptionover the door', 'Every-body is not obliged to live in the same way', '\"\"Do not be so angry, my good man,\" replied the Calender; \"we shouldbe very sorry to displease you;\" so the quarrel was smoothed over,and supper began in good earnest', 'When the Calenders had satisfiedtheir hunger, they offered to play to their hostesses, if there wereany instruments in the house', 'The ladies were delighted at the idea,and Sadie went to see what she could find, returning in a fewmoments laden with two different kinds of flutes and a tambourine', 'Each Calender took the one he preferred, and began to playa well-known air, while the ladies sang the words of the song', 'These words were the gayest and liveliest possible, and every nowand then the singers had to stop to indulge the laughter which almostchoked them', 'In the midst of all their noise, a knock was heardat the door', 'Now early that evening the Caliph secretly left the palace,accompanied by his grand-vizir, Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs,all three wearing the dresses of merchants', 'Passing down the street,the Caliph had been attracted by the music of instruments and the soundof laughter, and had ordered his vizir to go and knock at the doorof the house, as he wished to enter', 'The vizir replied that the ladieswho lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends, and he thoughthis master would do well not to intrude on them; but the Caliph hadtaken it into his head to see for himself, and insisted on being obeyed', 'The knock was answered by Sadie, with a taper in her hand,and the vizir, who was surprised at her beauty, bowed low before her,and said respectfully, \"Madam, we are three merchants who havelately arrived from Moussoul, and, owing to a misadventure whichbefel us this very night, only reached our inn to find that thedoors were closed to us till to-morrow morning', 'Not knowingwhat to do, we wandered in the streets till we happened to passyour house, when, seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices,we resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the dawn', 'If you will grant us this favour, we will, with your permission,do all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly', '\"Sadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her sisters;and after having talked over the matter with them, she returned to tellhim that he and his two friends would be welcome to join their company', 'They entered and bowed politely to the ladies and their guests', 'Then Zobeida, as the mistress, came forward and said gravely,\"You are welcome here, but I hope you will allow me to beg one thingof you--have as many eyes as you like, but no tongues; and askno questions about anything you see, however strange it may appearto you', '\"\"Madam,\" returned the vizir, \"you shall be obeyed', 'We have quiteenough to please and interest us without troubling ourselves aboutthat with which we have no concern', '\"  Then they all sat down,and drank to the health of the new comers', 'While the vizir, Giafar, was talking to the ladies the Caliphwas occupied in wondering who they could be, and why the threeCalenders had each lost his right eye', \"He was burning to inquirethe reason of it all, but was silenced by Zobeida's request, so hetried to rouse him-self and to take his part in the conversation,which was very lively, the subject of discussion being the manydifferent sorts of pleasures that there were in the world\", 'After some time the Calenders got up and performed some curious dances,which delighted the rest of the company', 'When they had finished Zobeida rose from her seat, and, taking Aminaby the hand, she said to her, \"My sister, our friends will excuse usif we seem to forget their presence and fulfil our nightly task', '\" Amina understood her sister\\'s meaning, and collecting the dishes,glasses, and musical instruments, she carried them away, while Sadieswept the hall and put everything in order', 'Having done this shebegged the Calenders to sit on a sofa on one side of the room,and the Caliph and his friends to place themselves opposite', 'As to the porter, she requested him to come and help her andher sister', 'Shortly after Amina entered carrying a seat, which she put downin the middle of the empty space', 'She next went over to the doorof a closet and signed to the porter to follow her', 'He did so,and soon reappeared leading two black dogs by a chain, which hebrought into the centre of the hall', 'Zobeida then got up from herseat between the Calenders and the Caliph and walked slowly acrossto where the porter stood with the dogs', '\"We must do our duty,\"she said with a deep sigh, pushing back her sleeves, and, taking awhip from Sadie, she said to the man, \"Take one of those dogs to mysister Amina and give me the other', '\"The porter did as he was bid, but as he led the dog to Zobeida ituttered piercing howls, and gazed up at her with looks of entreaty', 'But Zobeida took no notice, and whipped the dog till she wasout of breath', \"She then took the chain from the porter, and,raising the dog on its hind legs, they looked into each other's eyessorrowfully till tears began to fall from both\", 'Then Zobeida tookher handkerchief and wiped the dog\\'s eyes tenderly, after which shekissed it, then, putting the chain into the porter\\'s hand she said,\"Take it back to the closet and bring me the other', '\"The same ceremony was gone through with the second dog,and all the while the whole company looked on with astonishment', 'The Caliph in particular could hardly contain himself, and madesigns to the vizir to ask what it all meant', 'But the vizirpretended not to see, and turned his head away', 'Zobeida remained for some time in the middle of the room, till atlast Sadie went up to her and begged her to sit down, as shealso had her part to play', 'At these words Amina fetched a lutefrom a case of yellow satin and gave it to Sadie, who sang severalsongs to its accompaniment', 'When she was tired she said to Amina,\"My sister, I can do no more; come, I pray you, and take my place', '\"Amina struck a few chords and then broke into a song, which shesang with so much ardour that she was quite overcome, and sankgasping on a pile of cushions, tearing open her dress as she didso to give herself some air', 'To the amazement of all present,her neck, instead of being as smooth and white as her face,was a mass of scars', 'The Calenders and the Caliph looked at each other, and whispered together,unheard by Zobeida and Sadie, who were tending their fainting sister', '\"What does it all mean', '\" asked the Caliph', '\"We know no more than you,\" said the Calender to whom he had spoken', '\"What', 'You do not belong to the house', '\"\"My lord,\" answered all the Calenders together, \"we came herefor the first time an hour before you', '\"They then turned to the porter to see if he could explainthe mystery, but the porter was no wiser than they were themselves', 'At length the Caliph could contain his curiosity no longer,and declared that he would compel the ladies to tell them the meaningof their strange conduct', 'The vizir, foreseeing what would happen,implored him to remember the condition their hostesses had imposed,and added in a whisper that if his Highness would only wait tillmorning he could as Caliph summon the ladies to appear before him', 'But the Caliph, who was not accustomed to be contradicted,rejected this advice, and it was resolved after a little more talkingthat the question should be put by the porter', 'Suddenly Zobeidaturned round, and seeing their excitement she said, \"What is the matter--what are you all discussing so earnestly', '\"\"Madam,\" answered the porter, \"these gentlemen entreat you to explainto them why you should first whip the dogs and then cry over them,and also how it happens that the fainting lady is covered with scars', 'They have requested me, Madam, to be their mouthpiece', '\"\"Is it true, gentlemen,\" asked Zobeida, drawing herself up,\"that you have charged this man to put me that question', '\"\"It is,\" they all replied, except Giafar, who was silent', '\"Is this,\" continued Zobeida, growing more angry every moment,\"is this the return you make for the hospitality I have shown you', 'Have you forgotten the one condition on which you were allowedto enter the house', 'Come quickly,\" she added, clapping her handsthree times, and the words were hardly uttered when seven black slaves,each armed with a sabre, burst in and stood over the seven men,throwing them on the ground, and preparing themselves, on a sign fromtheir mistress, to cut off their heads', \"The seven culprits all thought their last hour had come, and theCaliph repented bitterly that he had not taken the vizir's advice\", \"But they made up their minds to die bravely, all except the porter,who loudly inquired of Zobeida why he was to suffer for otherpeople's faults, and declared that these misfortunes would neverhave happened if it had not been for the Calenders, who alwaysbrought ill-luck\", 'He ended by imploring Zobeida not to confoundthe innocent with the guilty and to spare his life', 'In spite of her anger, there was something so comic in the groansof the porter that Zobeida could not refrain from laughing', 'But putting him aside she addressed the others a second time,saying, \"Answer me; who are you', 'Unless you tell me truly youhave not another moment to live', 'I can hardly think you are menof any position, whatever country you belong to', 'If you were,you would have had more consideration for us', '\"The Caliph, who was naturally very impatient, suffered far morethan either of the others at feeling that his life was at themercy of a justly offended lady, but when he heard her questionhe began to breathe more freely, for he was convinced that shehad only to learn his name and rank for all danger to be over', 'So he whispered hastily to the vizir, who was next to him,to reveal their secret', 'But the vizir, wiser than his master,wished to conceal from the public the affront they had received,and merely answered, \"After all, we have only got what we deserved', '\"Meanwhile Zobeida had turned to the three Calenders and inquired if,as they were all blind, they were brothers', '\"No, madam,\" replied one, \"we are no blood relations at all,only brothers by our mode of life', '\"\"And you,\" she asked, addressing another, \"were you born blindof one eye', '\"\"No, madam,\" returned he, \"I became blind through a most surprisingadventure, such as probably has never happened to anybody', 'After that I shaved my head and eyebrows and put on the dressin which you see me now', '\"Zobeida put the same question to the other two Calenders,and received the same answer', '\"But,\" added the third, \"it may interest you, madam, to knowthat we are not men of low birth, but are all three sons of kings,and of kings, too, whom the world holds in high esteem', '\"At these words Zobeida\\'s anger cooled down, and she turned toher slaves and said, \"You can give them a little more liberty,but do not leave the hall', 'Those that will tell us their historiesand their reasons for coming here shall be allowed to leave unhurt;those who refuse--\" And she paused, but in a moment the porter,who understood that he had only to relate his story to set himselffree from this terrible danger, immediately broke in,\"Madam, you know already how I came here, and what I have to saywill soon be told', 'Your sister found me this morning in the placewhere I always stand waiting to be hired', 'She bade me follow herto various shops, and when my basket was quite full we returnedto this house, when you had the goodness to permit me to remain,for which I shall be eternally grateful', 'That is my story', '\"He looked anxiously to Zobeida, who nodded her head and said,\"You can go; and take care we never meet again', '\"\"Oh, madam,\" cried the porter, \"let me stay yet a little while', 'It is not just that the others should have heard my story and that Ishould not hear theirs,\" and without waiting for permission heseated himself on the end of the sofa occupied by the ladies,whilst the rest crouched on the carpet, and the slaves stood againstthe wall', 'Then one of the Calenders, addressing himself to Zobeida as theprincipal lady, began his story', 'The Story of the First Calender, Son of a KingIn order, madam, to explain how I came to lose my right eye,and to wear the dress of a Calender, you must first know that Iam the son of a king', \"My father's only brother reigned over theneighbouring country, and had two children, a daughter and a son,who were of the same age as myself\", \"As I grew up, and was allowed more liberty, I went every year to paya visit to my uncle's court, and usually stayed there about two months\", 'In this way my cousin and I became very intimate, and were muchattached to each other', 'The very last time I saw him he seemed moredelighted to see me than ever, and gave a great feast in my honour', 'When we had finished eating, he said to me, \"My cousin, you wouldnever guess what I have been doing since your last visit to us', 'Directly after your departure I set a number of men to work on a buildingafter my own design', 'It is now completed, and ready to be lived in', 'I should like to show it to you, but you must first swear two things: to be faithful to me, and to keep my secret', '\"Of course I did not dream of refusing him anything he asked, and gavethe promise without the least hesitation', 'He then bade me waitan instant, and vanished, returning in a few moments with a richlydressed lady of great beauty, but as he did not tell me her name,I thought it was better not to inquire', \"We all three sat down to tableand amused ourselves with talking of all sorts of indifferent things,and with drinking each other's health\", 'Suddenly the prince said to me,\"Cousin, we have no time to lose; be so kind as to conduct this ladyto a certain spot, where you will find a dome-like tomb, newly built', 'You cannot mistake it', 'Go in, both of you, and wait till I come', 'I shall not be long', '\"As I had promised I prepared to do as I was told, and giving my handto the lady, I escorted her, by the light of the moon, to the placeof which the prince had spoken', 'We had barely reached it when hejoined us himself, carrying a small vessel of water, a pickaxe,and a little bag containing plaster', 'With the pickaxe he at once began to destroy the empty sepulchrein the middle of the tomb', 'One by one he took the stones and piledthem up in a corner', 'When he had knocked down the whole sepulchrehe proceeded to dig at the earth, and beneath where the sepulchrehad been I saw a trap-door', 'He raised the door and I caught sightof the top of a spiral staircase; then he said, turning to the lady,\"Madam, this is the way that will lead you down to the spot which Itold you of', '\"The lady did not answer, but silently descended the staircase,the prince following her', 'At the top, however, he looked at me', '\"My cousin,\" he exclaimed, \"I do not know how to thank you foryour kindness', 'Farewell', '\"\"What do you mean', '\"  I cried', '\"I don\\'t understand', '\"\"No matter,\" he replied, \"go back by the path that you came', '\"He would say no more, and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my roomin the palace and went to bed', 'When I woke, and consideredmy adventure, I thought that I must have been dreaming, and senta servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me', 'But on hearing that he had not slept at home I was much alarmed,and hastened to the cemetery, where, unluckily, the tombs were all soalike that I could not discover which was the one I was in search of,though I spent four days in looking for it', 'You must know that all this time the king, my uncle, was absenton a hunting expedition, and as no one knew when he would be back,I at last decided to return home, leaving the ministers to makemy excuses', 'I longed to tell them what had become of the prince,about whose fate they felt the most dreadful anxiety, but the oath Ihad sworn kept me silent', \"On my arrival at my father's capital, I was astonished to finda large detachment of guards drawn up before the gate of the palace;they surrounded me directly I entered\", 'I asked the officers in commandthe reason of this strange behaviour, and was horrified to learnthat the army had mutinied and put to death the king, my father,and had placed the grand-vizir on the throne', 'Further, that by hisorders I was placed under arrest', 'Now this rebel vizir had hated me from my boy-hood, because once,when shooting at a bird with a bow, I had shot out his eye by accident', 'Of course I not only sent a servant at once to offer him my regretsand apologies, but I made them in person', 'It was all of no use', 'He cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no occasionof showing it', 'Having once got me in his power I felt he couldshow no mercy, and I was right', 'Mad with triumph and fury hecame to me in my prison and tore out my right eye', 'That is how Ilost it', 'My persecutor, however, did not stop here', 'He shut me up in a largecase and ordered his executioner to carry me into a desert place,to cut off my head, and then to abandon my body to the birds of prey', 'The case, with me inside it, was accordingly placed on a horse,and the executioner, accompanied by another man, rode into the countryuntil they found a spot suitable for the purpose', 'But their heartswere not so hard as they seemed, and my tears and prayers madethem waver', '\"Forsake the kingdom instantly,\" said the executioner at last,\"and take care never to come back, for you will not only loseyour head, but make us lose ours', '\"  I thanked him gratefully,and tried to console myself for the loss of my eye by thinkingof the other misfortunes I had escaped', 'After all I had gone through, and my fear of being recognisedby some enemy, I could only travel very slowly and cautiously,generally resting in some out-of-the-way place by day, and walkingas far as I was able by night, but at length I arrived in the kingdomof my uncle, of whose protection I was sure', 'I found him in great trouble about the disappearance of his son,who had, he said, vanished without leaving a trace; but his own griefdid not prevent him sharing mine', 'We mingled our tears, for the lossof one was the loss of the other, and then I made up my mind that itwas my duty to break the solemn oath I had sworn to the prince', 'I therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything I knew,and I observed that even before I had ended his sorrow appeared to belightened a little', '\"My dear nephew,\" he said, \"your story gives me some hope', 'I was aware that my son was building a tomb, and I think I can findthe spot', 'But as he wished to keep the matter secret, let us goalone and seek the place ourselves', '\"He then bade me disguise myself, and we both slipped out of agarden door which opened on to the cemetery', \"It did not takelong for us to arrive at the scene of the prince's disappearance,or to discover the tomb I had sought so vainly before\", 'We entered it, and found the trap-door which led to the staircase,but we had great difficulty in raising it, because the prince hadfastened it down underneath with the plaster he had brought with him', 'My uncle went first, and I followed him', 'When we reached the bottomof the stairs we stepped into a sort of ante-room, filled withsuch a dense smoke that it was hardly possible to see anything', 'However, we passed through the smoke into a large chamber,which at first seemed quite empty', 'The room was brilliantly lighted,and in another moment we perceived a sort of platform at one end,on which were the bodies of the prince and a lady, both half-burned,as if they had been dragged out of a fire before it had quiteconsumed them', 'This horrible sight turned me faint, but, to my surprise, my uncledid not show so much surprise as anger', '\"I knew,\" he said, \"that my son was tenderly attached to this lady,whom it was impossible he should ever marry', 'I tried to turnhis thoughts, and presented to him the most beautiful princesses,but he cared for none of them, and, as you see, they have now beenunited by a horrible death in an underground tomb', '\"  But, as he spoke,his anger melted into tears, and again I wept with him', 'When he recovered himself he drew me to him', '\"My dear nephew,\"he said, embracing me, \"you have come to me to take his place,and I will do my best to forget that I ever had a son who could actin so wicked a manner', '\"  Then he turned and went up the stairs', 'We reached the palace without anyone having noticed our absence,when, shortly after, a clashing of drums, and cymbals, and the blareof trumpets burst upon our astonished ears', 'At the same time a thickcloud of dust on the horizon told of the approach of a great army', 'My heart sank when I perceived that the commander was the vizirwho had dethroned my father, and was come to seize the kingdomof my uncle', 'The capital was utterly unprepared to stand a siege, and seeingthat resistance was useless, at once opened its gates', 'My unclefought hard for his life, but was soon overpowered, and when hefell I managed to escape through a secret passage, and took refugewith an officer whom I knew I could trust', 'Persecuted by ill-fortune, and stricken with grief, there seemedto be only one means of safety left to me', 'I shaved my beardand my eyebrows, and put on the dress of a calender, in which itwas easy for me to travel without being known', 'I avoided the townstill I reached the kingdom of the famous and powerful Caliph,Haroun-al-Raschid, when I had no further reason to fear my enemies', 'It was my intention to come to Bagdad and to throw myself at the feetof his Highness, who would, I felt certain, be touched by my sad story,and would grant me, besides, his help and protection', 'After a journey which lasted some months I arrived at length at thegates of this city', 'It was sunset, and I paused for a little to lookabout me, and to decide which way to turn my steps', 'I was stilldebating on this subject when I was joined by this other calender,who stopped to greet me', '\"You, like me, appear to be a stranger,\"I said', 'He replied that I was right, and before he could say morethe third calender came up', 'He, also, was newly arrived in Bagdad,and being brothers in misfortune, we resolved to cast in ourlots together, and to share whatever fate might have in store', 'By this time it had grown late, and we did not know where to spendthe night', 'But our lucky star having guided us to this door,we took the liberty of knocking and of asking for shelter,which was given to us at once with the best grace in the world', 'This, madam, is my story', '\"I am satisfied,\" replied Zobeida; \"you can go when you like', '\"The calender, however, begged leave to stay and to hear the historiesof his two friends and of the three other persons of the company,which he was allowed to do', 'The Story of the Second Calendar, Son of a King\"Madam,\" said the young man, addressing Zobeida, \"if you wishto know how I lost my right eye, I shall have to tell you the storyof my whole life', '\"I was scarcely more than a baby, when the king my father,finding me unusually quick and clever for my age, turned histhoughts to my education', 'I was taught first to read and write,and then to learn the Koran, which is the basis of our holy religion,and the better to understand it, I read with my tutors the ablestcommentators on its teaching, and committed to memory all thetraditions respecting the Prophet, which have been gathered fromthe mouth of those who were his friends', 'I also learnt history,and was instructed in poetry, versification, geography, chronology,and in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should excel', 'But what I liked best of all was writing Arabic characters,and in this I soon surpassed my masters, and gained a reputationin this branch of knowledge that reached as far as India itself', 'Now the Sultan of the Indies, curious to see a young princewith such strange tastes, sent an ambassador to my father,laden with rich presents, and a warm invitation to visit his court', 'My father, who was deeply anxious to secure the friendship of sopowerful a monarch, and held besides that a little travel wouldgreatly improve my manners and open my mind, accepted gladly,and in a short time I had set out for India with the ambassador,attended only by a small suite on account of the length of the journey,and the badness of the roads', 'However, as was my duty, I tookwith me ten camels, laden with rich presents for the Sultan', 'We had been travelling for about a month, when one day we saw a cloudof dust moving swiftly towards us; and as soon as it came near,we found that the dust concealed a band of fifty robbers', 'Our men barely numbered half, and as we were also hampered bythe camels, there was no use in fighting, so we tried to overawethem by informing them who we were, and whither we were going', 'The robbers, however, only laughed, and declared that was noneof their business, and, without more words, attacked us brutally', 'I defended myself to the last, wounded though I was, but at length,seeing that resistance was hopeless, and that the ambassadorand all our followers were made prisoners, I put spurs to my horseand rode away as fast as I could, till the poor beast fell deadfrom a wound in his side', 'I managed to jump off without any injury,and looked about to see if I was pursued', 'But for the moment Iwas safe, for, as I imagined, the robbers were all engaged inquarrelling over their booty', 'I found myself in a country that was quite new to me, and darednot return to the main road lest I should again fall into thehands of the robbers', 'Luckily my wound was only a slight one,and after binding it up as well as I could, I walked on for therest of the day, till I reached a cave at the foot of a mountain,where I passed the night in peace, making my supper off some fruitsI had gathered on the way', 'I wandered about for a whole month without knowing where I was going,till at length I found myself on the outskirts of a beautiful city,watered by winding streams, which enjoyed an eternal spring', 'My delight at the prospect of mixing once more with human beings wassomewhat damped at the thought of the miserable object I must seem', 'My face and hands had been burned nearly black; my clothes were allin rags, and my shoes were in such a state that I had been forced toabandon them altogether', 'I entered the town, and stopped at a tailor s shop to inquirewhere I was', 'The man saw I was better than my condition,and begged me to sit down, and in return I told him my whole story', 'The tailor listened with attention, but his reply, instead of givingme consolation, only increased my trouble', '\"Beware,\" he said, \"of telling any one what you have told me,for the prince who governs the kingdom is your father\\'s greatest enemy,and he will be rejoiced to find you in his power', '\"I thanked the tailor for his counsel, and said I would do whateverhe advised; then, being very hungry, I gladly ate of the food heput before me, and accepted his offer of a lodging in his house', 'In a few days I had quite recovered from the hardships I had undergone,and then the tailor, knowing that it was the custom for the princesof our religion to learn a trade or profession so as to provide forthemselves in times of ill-fortune, inquired if there was anythingI could do for my living', 'I replied that I had been educatedas a grammarian and a poet, but that my great gift was writing', '\"All that is of no use here,\" said the tailor', '\"Take my advice,put on a short coat, and as you seem hardy and strong, go intothe woods and cut firewood, which you will sell in the streets', 'By this means you will earn your living, and be able to wait tillbetter times come', 'The hatchet and the cord shall be my present', '\"This counsel was very distasteful to me, but I thought I could notdo otherwise than adopt it', 'So the next morning I set out with acompany of poor wood-cutters, to whom the tailor had introduced me', 'Even on the first day I cut enough wood to sell for a tolerable sum,and very soon I became more expert, and had made enough moneyto repay the tailor all he had lent me', 'I had been a wood-cutter for more than a year, when one day Iwandered further into the forest than I had ever done before,and reached a delicious green glade, where I began to cut wood', 'I was hacking at the root of a tree, when I beheld an iron ring fastenedto a trapdoor of the same metal', 'I soon cleared away the earth,and pulling up the door, found a staircase, which I hastily made upmy mind to go down, carrying my hatchet with me by way of protection', 'When I reached the bottom I discovered that I was in a huge palace,as brilliantly lighted as any palace above ground that I had ever seen,with a long gallery supported by pillars of jasper, ornamented withcapitals of gold', 'Down this gallery a lady came to meet me,of such beauty that I forgot everything else, and thought onlyof her', 'To save her all the trouble possible, I hastened towards her,and bowed low', '\"Who are you', 'Who are you', '\" she said', '\"A man or a genius', '\"\"A man, madam,\" I replied; \"I have nothing to do with genii', '\"\"By what accident do you come here', '\" she asked again with a sigh', '\"I have been in this place now for five and twenty years, and you arethe first man who has visited me', '\"Emboldened by her beauty and gentleness, I ventured to reply,\"Before, madam, I answer your question, allow me to say how grateful Iam for this meeting, which is not only a consolation to me in my ownheavy sorrow, but may perhaps enable me to render your lot happier,\"and then I told her who I was, and how I had come there', '\"Alas, prince,\" she said, with a deeper sigh than before, \"you haveguessed rightly in supposing me an unwilling prisoner in thisgorgeous place', 'I am the daughter of the king of the Ebony Isle,of whose fame you surely must have heard', \"At my father's desire I wasmarried to a prince who was my own cousin; but on my very wedding day,I was snatched up by a genius, and brought here in a faint\", 'For a long while I did nothing but weep, and would not sufferthe genius to come near me; but time teaches us submission,and I have now got accustomed to his presence, and if clothes andjewels could content me, I have them in plenty', 'Every tenth day,for five and twenty years, I have received a visit from him,but in case I should need his help at any other time, I have onlyto touch a talisman that stands at the entrance of my chamber', 'It wants still five days to his next visit, and I hope that duringthat time you will do me the honour to be my guest', '\"I was too much dazzled by her beauty to dream of refusing her offer,and accordingly the princess had me conducted to the bath,and a rich dress befitting my rank was provided for me', 'Then a feast of the most delicate dishes was served in a roomhung with embroidered Indian fabrics', 'Next day, when we were at dinner, I could maintain my patienceno longer, and implored the princess to break her bonds, and returnwith me to the world which was lighted by the sun', '\"What you ask is impossible,\" she answered; \"but stay here withme instead, and we can be happy, and all you will have to dois to betake yourself to the forest every tenth day, when I amexpecting my master the genius', 'He is very jealous, as you know,and will not suffer a man to come near me', '\"\"Princess,\" I replied, \"I see it is only fear of the genius thatmakes you act like this', 'For myself, I dread him so little that Imean to break his talisman in pieces', 'Awful though you think him,he shall feel the weight of my arm, and I herewith take a solemnvow to stamp out the whole race', '\"The princess, who realized the consequences of such audacity,entreated me not to touch the talisman', '\"If you do, it will be theruin of both of us,\" said she; \"I know genii much better than you', '\" But the wine I had drunk had confused my brain; I gave one kickto the talisman, and it fell into a thousand pieces', 'Hardly had my foot touched the talisman when the air became as darkas night, a fearful noise was heard, and the palace shook to itsvery foundations', 'In an instant I was sobered, and understoodwhat I had done', '\"Princess', '\"  I cried, \"what is happening', '\"\"Alas', '\" she exclaimed, forgetting all her own terrors in anxietyfor me, \"fly, or you are lost', '\"I followed her advice and dashed up the staircase, leaving myhatchet behind me', 'But I was too late', 'The palace opened and thegenius appeared, who, turning angrily to the princess, asked indignantly,\"What is the matter, that you have sent for me like this', '\"\"A pain in my heart,\" she replied hastily, \"obliged me to seekthe aid of this little bottle', 'Feeling faint, I slipped and fellagainst the talisman, which broke', 'That is really all', '\"\"You are an impudent liar', '\" cried the genius', '\"How did this hatchetand those shoes get here', '\"\"I never saw them before,\" she answered, \"and you came in sucha hurry that you may have picked them up on the road withoutknowing it', '\"  To this the genius only replied by insults and blows', 'I could hear the shrieks and groans of the princess, and havingby this time taken off my rich garments and put on those in which Ihad arrived the previous day, I lifted the trap, found myselfonce more in the forest, and returned to my friend the tailor,with a light load of wood and a heart full of shame and sorrow', 'The tailor, who had been uneasy at my long absence, was, delighted tosee me; but I kept silence about my adventure, and as soon aspossible retired to my room to lament in secret over my folly', 'While I was thus indulging my grief my host entered, and said,\"There is an old man downstairs who has brought your hatchetand slippers, which he picked up on the road, and now restoresto you, as he found out from one of your comrades where you lived', 'You had better come down and speak to him yourself', '\"  At thisspeech I changed colour, and my legs trembled under me', 'The tailornoticed my confusion, and was just going to inquire the reasonwhen the door of the room opened, and the old man appeared,carrying with him my hatchet and shoes', '\"I am a genius,\" he said, \"the son of the daughter of Eblis,prince of the genii', 'Is not this hatchet yours, and these shoes', '\" Without waiting for an answer--which, indeed, I could hardlyhave given him, so great was my fright--he seized hold of me,and darted up into the air with the quickness of lightning,and then, with equal swiftness, dropped down towards the earth', 'When he touched the ground, he rapped it with his foot; it opened,and we found ourselves in the enchanted palace, in the presenceof the beautiful princess of the Ebony Isle', 'But how different shelooked from what she was when I had last seen her, for she was lyingstretched on the ground covered with blood, and weeping bitterly', '\"Traitress', '\" cried the genius, \"is not this man your lover', '\"She lifted up her eyes slowly, and looked sadly at me', '\"I neversaw him before, she answered slowly', 'I do not know who he is', '\"\"What', '\" exclaimed the genius, \"you owe all your sufferings to him,and yet you dare to say he is a stranger to you', '\"\"But if he really is a stranger to me,\" she replied, \"why should Itell a lie and cause his death', '\"\"Very well,\" said the genius, drawing his sword, \"take this,and cut off his head', '\"\"Alas,\" answered the princess, \"I am too weak even to hold the sabre', 'And supposing that I had the strength, why should I put an innocentman to death', '\"\"You condemn yourself by your refusal,\" said the genius; then turningto me, he added, \"and you, do you not know her', '\"\"How should I', '\"  I replied, resolved to imitate the princessin her fidelity', '\"How should I, when I never saw her before', '\"\"Cut her head off,\" then, \"if she is a stranger to you, and I shallbelieve you are speaking the truth, and will set you at liberty', '\"\"Certainly,\" I answered, taking the sabre in my hands, and makinga sign to the princess to fear nothing, as it was my own life that Iwas about to sacrifice, and not hers', 'But the look of gratitudeshe gave me shook my courage, and I flung the sabre to the earth', '\"I should not deserve to live,\" I said to the genius, \"if I weresuch a coward as to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me,but who is at this moment half dead herself', 'Do with me as you will--I am in your power--but I refuse to obey your cruel command', '\"\"I see,\" said the genius, \"that you have both made up your mindsto brave me, but I will give you a sample of what you may expect', '\"So saying, with one sweep of his sabre he cut off a hand of the princess,who was just able to lift the other to wave me an eternal farewell', 'Then I lost consciousness for several minutes', 'When I came to myself I implored the genius to keep me no longerin this state of suspense, but to lose no time in putting an end tomy sufferings', 'The genius, however, paid no attention to my prayers,but said sternly, \"That is the way in which a genius treats the womanwho has betrayed him', 'If I chose, I could kill you also; but Iwill be merciful, and content myself with changing you into a dog,an ass, a lion, or a bird--which-ever you prefer', '\"I caught eagerly at these words, as giving me a faint hopeof softening his wrath', '\"O genius', '\"  I cried, \"as you wishto spare my life, be generous, and spare it altogether', 'Grant my prayer, and pardon my crime, as the best man in the wholeworld forgave his neighbour who was eaten up with envy of him', '\" Contrary to my hopes, the genius seemed interested in my words,and said he would like to hear the story of the two neighbours;and as I think, madam, it may please you, I will tell it to you also', 'The Story of the Envious Man and of Him Who Was EnviedIn a town of moderate size, two men lived in neighbouring houses;but they had not been there very long before one man took such ahatred of the other, and envied him so bitterly, that the poor mandetermined to find another home, hoping that when they no longermet every day his enemy would forget all about him', 'So he soldhis house and the little furniture it contained, and moved intothe capital of the country, which was luckily at no great distance', 'About half a mile from this city he bought a nice little place,with a large garden and a fair-sized court, in the centre of whichstood an old well', 'In order to live a quieter life, the good man put on the robeof a dervish, and divided his house into a quantity of small cells,where he soon established a number of other dervishes', 'The fame of his virtue gradually spread abroad, and many people,including several of the highest quality, came to visit him and askhis prayers', 'Of course it was not long before his reputation reached the ears ofthe man who envied him, and this wicked wretch resolved never to resttill he had in some way worked ill to the dervish whom he hated', 'So he left his house and his business to look after themselves,and betook himself to the new dervish monastery, where he waswelcomed by the founder with all the warmth imaginable', 'The excusehe gave for his appearance was that he had come to consult thechief of the dervishes on a private matter of great importance', '\"What I have to say must not be overheard,\" he whispered;\"command, I beg of you, that your dervishes retire into their cells,as night is approaching, and meet me in the court', '\"The dervish did as he was asked without delay, and directly theywere alone together the envious man began to tell a long story,edging, as they walked to and fro, always nearer to the well, and whenthey were quite close, he seized the dervish and dropped him in', 'He then ran off triumphantly, without having been seen by anyone,and congratulating himself that the object of his hatred was dead,and would trouble him no more', 'But in this he was mistaken', 'The old well had long been inhabited(unknown to mere human beings) by a set of fairies and genii,who caught the dervish as he fell, so that he received no hurt', 'The dervish himself could see nothing, but he took for granted thatsomething strange had happened, or he must certainly have been dashedagainst the side of the well and been killed', 'He lay quite still,and in a moment he heard a voice saying, \"Can you guess whom this manis that we have saved from death', '\"\"No,\" replied several other voices', 'And the first speaker answered, \"I will tell you', 'This man,from pure goodness of heart, forsook the town where he lived andcame to dwell here, in the hope of curing one of his neighboursof the envy he felt towards him', \"But his character soon won himthe esteem of all, and the envious man's hatred grew, till hecame here with the deliberate intention of causing his death\", 'And this he would have done, without our help, the very day beforethe Sultan has arranged to visit this holy dervish, and to entreathis prayers for the princess, his daughter', '\"\"But what is the matter with the princess that she needsthe dervish\\'s prayers', '\" asked another voice', '\"She has fallen into the power of the genius Maimoum, the son of Dimdim,\"replied the first voice', '\"But it would be quite simple for thisholy chief of the dervishes to cure her if he only knew', 'In hisconvent there is a black cat which has a tiny white tip to its tail', 'Now to cure the princess the dervish must pull out seven of thesewhite hairs, burn three, and with their smoke perfume the headof the princess', 'This will deliver her so completely that Maimoum,the son of Dimdim, will never dare to approach her again', '\"The fairies and genii ceased talking, but the dervish did not forgeta word of all they had said; and when morning came he perceiveda place in the side of the well which was broken, and where hecould easily climb out', 'The dervishes, who could not imagine what had become of him,were enchanted at his reappearance', 'He told them of the attempt onhis life made by his guest of the previous day, and then retired intohis cell', 'He was soon joined here by the black cat of which the voicehad spoken, who came as usual to say good-morning to his master', 'He took him on his knee and seized the opportunity to pull sevenwhite hairs out of his tail, and put them on one side till theywere needed', 'The sun had not long risen before the Sultan, who was anxiousto leave nothing undone that might deliver the princess,arrived with a large suite at the gate of the monastery,and was received by the dervishes with profound respect', 'The Sultan lost no time in declaring the object of his visit,and leading the chief of the dervishes aside, he said to him,\"Noble scheik, you have guessed perhaps what I have come to ask you', '\"\"Yes, sire,\" answered the dervish; \"if I am not mistaken, it isthe illness of the princess which has procured me this honour', '\"\"You are right,\" returned the Sultan, \"and you will give me freshlife if you can by your prayers deliver my daughter from the strangemalady that has taken possession of her', '\"\"Let your highness command her to come here, and I will see what Ican do', '\"The Sultan, full of hope, sent orders at once that the princesswas to set out as soon as possible, accompanied by her usual staffof attendants', 'When she arrived, she was so thickly veiled thatthe dervish could not see her face, but he desired a brazier to beheld over her head, and laid the seven hairs on the burning coals', 'The instant they were consumed, terrific cries were heard,but no one could tell from whom they proceeded', 'Only the dervishguessed that they were uttered by Maimoum the son of Dimdim,who felt the princess escaping him', 'All this time she had seemed unconscious of what she was doing,but now she raised her hand to her veil and uncovered her face', '\"Where am I', 'she said in a bewildered manner; and how did Iget here', '\"The Sultan was so delighted to hear these words that he not onlyembraced his daughter, but kissed the hand of the dervish', 'Then, turning to his attendants who stood round, he said to them,\"What reward shall I give to the man who has restored me my daughter', '\"They all replied with one accord that he deserved the handof the princess', '\"That is my own opinion,\" said he, \"and from this moment I declarehim to be my son-in-law', '\"Shortly after these events, the grand-vizir died, and his postwas given to the dervish', 'But he did not hold it for long, for theSultan fell a victim to an attack of illness, and as he had no sons,the soldiers and priests declared the dervish heir to the throne,to the great joy of all the people', 'One day, when the dervish, who had now become Sultan, was makinga royal progress with his court, he perceived the envious man standingin the crowd', 'He made a sign to one of his vizirs, and whispered inhis ear, \"Fetch me that man who is standing out there, but take greatcare not to frighten him', '\"  The vizir obeyed, and when the envious manwas brought before the Sultan, the monarch said to him, \"My friend,I am delighted to see you again', '\"  Then turning to an officer,he added, \"Give him a thousand pieces of gold out of my treasury,and twenty waggon-loads of merchandise out of my private stores,and let an escort of soldiers accompany him home', '\"  He then tookleave of the envious man, and went on his way', 'Now when I had ended my story, I proceeded to show the geniushow to apply it to himself', '\"O genius,\" I said, \"you see that thisSultan was not content with merely forgiving the envious manfor the attempt on his life; he heaped rewards and riches upon him', '\"But the genius had made up his mind, and could not be softened', '\"Do not imagine that you are going to escape so easily,\" he said', '\"All I can do is to give you bare life; you will have to learn whathappens to people who interfere with me', '\"As he spoke he seized me violently by the arm; the roof of the palaceopened to make way for us, and we mounted up so high into the airthat the earth looked like a little cloud', 'Then, as before,he came down with the swiftness of lightning, and we touchedthe ground on a mountain top', 'Then he stooped and gathered a handful of earth, and murmured somewords over it, after which he threw the earth in my face, saying ashe did so, \"Quit the form of a man, and assume that of a monkey', '\" This done, he vanished, and I was in the likeness of an ape,and in a country I had never seen before', 'However there was no use in stopping where I was, so I came downthe mountain and found myself in a flat plain which was boundedby the sea', 'I travelled towards it, and was pleased to see avessel moored about half a mile from shore', 'There were no waves,so I broke off the branch of a tree, and dragging it down to thewaters edge, sat across it, while, using two sticks for oars,I rowed myself towards the ship', 'The deck was full of people, who watched my progress with interest,but when I seized a rope and swung myself on board, I found that Ihad only escaped death at the hands of the genius to perishby those of the sailors, lest I should bring ill-luck to thevessel and the merchants', '\"Throw him into the sea', '\" cried one', '\"Knock him on the head with a hammer,\" exclaimed another', '\"Let meshoot him with an arrow,\" said a third; and certainly somebodywould have had his way if I had not flung myself at the captain\\'sfeet and grasped tight hold of his dress', 'He appeared touchedby my action and patted my head, and declared that he would takeme under his protection, and that no one should do me any harm', 'At the end of about fifty days we cast anchor before a large town,and the ship was immediately surrounded by a multitude of smallboats filled with people, who had come either to meet their friendsor from simple curiosity', 'Among others, one boat contained severalofficials, who asked to see the merchants on board, and informedthem that they had been sent by the Sultan in token of welcome,and to beg them each to write a few lines on a roll of paper', '\"In order to explain this strange request,\" continued the officers,\"it is necessary that you should know that the grand-vizir,lately dead, was celebrated for his beautiful handwriting,and the Sultan is anxious to find a similar talent in his successor', 'Hitherto the search has been a failure, but his Highness has not yetgiven up hope', '\"One after another the merchants set down a few lines upon the roll,and when they had all finished, I came forward, and snatchedthe paper from the man who held it', 'At first they all thought Iwas going to throw it into the sea, but they were quieted when theysaw I held it with great care, and great was their surprise when Imade signs that I too wished to write something', '\"Let him do it if he wants to,\" said the captain', '\"If he only makesa mess of the paper, you may be sure I will punish him for it', 'But if, as I hope, he really can write, for he is the cleverestmonkey I ever saw, I will adopt him as my son', 'The one I lost hadnot nearly so much sense', '\"No more was said, and I took the pen and wrote the six sortsof writing in use among the Arabs, and each sort containedan original verse or couplet, in praise of the Sultan', 'And notonly did my handwriting completely eclipse that of the merchants,but it is hardly too much to say that none so beautiful had everbefore been seen in that country', 'When I had ended the officialstook the roll and returned to the Sultan', 'As soon as the monarch saw my writing he did not so much as lookat the samples of the merchants, but desired his officials to takethe finest and most richly caparisoned horse in his stables,together with the most magnificent dress they could procure,and to put it on the person who had written those lines, and bringhim to court', 'The officials began to laugh when they heard the Sultan\\'s command,but as soon as they could speak they said, \"Deign, your highness,to excuse our mirth, but those lines were not written by a manbut by a monkey', '\"\"A monkey', '\" exclaimed the Sultan', '\"Yes, sire,\" answered the officials', '\"They were written by a monkeyin our presence', '\"\"Then bring me the monkey,\" he replied, \"as fast as you can', '\"The Sultan\\'s officials returned to the ship and showed the royalorder to the captain', '\"He is the master,\" said the good man, and desired that I shouldbe sent for', 'Then they put on me the gorgeous robe and rowed me to land, where Iwas placed on the horse and led to the palace', 'Here the Sultanwas awaiting me in great state surrounded by his court', 'All the way along the streets I had been the object of curiosityto a vast crowd, which had filled every doorway and every window,and it was amidst their shouts and cheers that I was ushered intothe presence of the Sultan', 'I approached the throne on which he was seated and made him threelow bows, then prostrated myself at his feet to the surprise of everyone,who could not understand how it was possible that a monkey shouldbe able to distinguish a Sultan from other people, and to pay himthe respect due to his rank', 'However, excepting the usual speech,I omitted none of the common forms attending a royal audience', 'When it was over the Sultan dismissed all the court, keeping with himonly the chief of the eunuchs and a little slave', 'He then passedinto another room and ordered food to be brought, making signsto me to sit at table with him and eat', 'I rose from my seat,kissed the ground, and took my place at the table, eating, as youmay suppose, with care and in moderation', 'Before the dishes were removed I made signs that writing materials,which stood in one corner of the room, should be laid in front of me', 'I then took a peach and wrote on it some verses in praise of the Sultan,who was speechless with astonishment; but when I did the samething on a glass from which I had drunk he murmured to himself,\"Why, a man who could do as much would be cleverer than any other man,and this is only a monkey', '\"Supper being over chessmen were brought, and the Sultan signed to meto know if I would play with him', 'I kissed the ground and laid my handon my head to show that I was ready to show myself worthy of the honour', 'He beat me the first game, but I won the second and third, and seeingthat this did not quite please I dashed off a verse by way of consolation', 'The Sultan was so enchanted with all the talents of which I had givenproof that he wished me to exhibit some of them to other people', 'So turning to the chief of the eunuchs he said, \"Go and beg my daughter,Queen of Beauty, to come here', 'I will show her something she hasnever seen before', '\"The chief of the eunuchs bowed and left the room, ushering in a fewmoments later the princess, Queen of Beauty', 'Her face was uncovered,but the moment she set foot in the room she threw her veil overher head', '\"Sire,\" she said to her father, \"what can you be thinkingof to summon me like this into the presence of a man', '\"\"I do not understand you,\" replied the Sultan', '\"There is nobodyhere but the eunuch, who is your own servant, the little slave,and myself, yet you cover yourself with your veil and reproach mefor having sent for you, as if I had committed a crime', '\"\"Sire,\" answered the princess, \"I am right and you are wrong', 'This monkey is really no monkey at all, but a young prince who hasbeen turned into a monkey by the wicked spells of a genius, son ofthe daughter of Eblis', '\"As will be imagined, these words took the Sultan by surprise, and helooked at me to see how I should take the statement of the princess', 'As I was unable to speak, I placed my hand on my head to show that itwas true', '\"But how do you know this, my daughter', '\" asked he', '\"Sire,\" replied Queen of Beauty, \"the old lady who took care of mein my childhood was an accomplished magician, and she taught meseventy rules of her art, by means of which I could, in the twinklingof an eye, transplant your capital into the middle of the ocean', 'Her art likewise teaches me to recognise at first sight all personswho are enchanted, and tells me by whom the spell was wrought', '\"\"My daughter,\" said the Sultan, \"I really had no idea you wereso clever', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the princess, \"there are many out-of-the-way thingsit is as well to know, but one should never boast of them', '\"\"Well,\" asked the Sultan, \"can you tell me what must be doneto disenchant the young prince', '\"\"Certainly; and I can do it', '\"\"Then restore him to his former shape,\" cried the Sultan', '\"You could give me no greater pleasure, for I wish to make himmy grand-vizir, and to give him to you for your husband', '\"\"As your Highness pleases,\" replied the princess', 'Queen of Beauty rose and went to her chamber, from which shefetched a knife with some Hebrew words engraven on the blade', 'She then desired the Sultan, the chief of the eunuchs, the littleslave, and myself to descend into a secret court of the palace,and placed us beneath a gallery which ran all round, she herselfstanding in the centre of the court', 'Here she traced a largecircle and in it wrote several words in Arab characters', 'When the circle and the writing were finished she stood in the middleof it and repeated some verses from the Koran', 'Slowly the airgrew dark, and we felt as if the earth was about to crumble away,and our fright was by no means diminished at seeing the genius,son of the daughter of Eblis, suddenly appear under the form of acolossal lion', '\"Dog,\" cried the princess when she first caught sight of him,\"you think to strike terror into me by daring to present yourselfbefore me in this hideous shape', '\"\"And you,\" retorted the lion, \"have not feared to break our treatythat engaged solemnly we should never interfere with each other', '\"\"Accursed genius', '\" exclaimed the princess, \"it is you by whomthat treaty was first broken', '\"\"I will teach you how to give me so much trouble,\" said the lion,and opening his huge mouth he advanced to swallow her', 'But theprincess expected something of the sort and was on her guard', 'She bounded on one side, and seizing one of the hairs of his manerepeated two or three words over it', \"In an instant it became a sword,and with a sharp blow she cut the lion's body into two pieces\", \"These pieces vanished no one knew where, and only the lion'shead remained, which was at once changed into a scorpion\", 'Quick as thought the princess assumed the form of a serpentand gave battle to the scorpion, who, finding he was gettingthe worst of it, turned himself into an eagle and took flight', 'But in a moment the serpent had become an eagle more powerful still,who soared up in the air and after him, and then we lost sight ofthem both', 'We all remained where we were quaking with anxiety, when the groundopened in front of us and a black and white cat leapt out, its hairstanding on end, and miauing frightfully', 'At its heels was a wolf,who had almost seized it, when the cat changed itself into a worm,and, piercing the skin of a pomegranate which had tumbled from a tree,hid itself in the fruit', 'The pomegranate swelled till it grew aslarge as a pumpkin, and raised itself on to the roof of the gallery,from which it fell into the court and was broken into bits', 'While this was taking place the wolf, who had transformed himselfinto a cock, began to swallow the seed of the pomegranate as fastas he could', 'When all were gone he flew towards us, flapping hiswings as if to ask if we saw any more, when suddenly his eye fellon one which lay on the bank of the little canal that flowedthrough the court; he hastened towards it, but before he could touchit the seed rolled into the canal and became a fish', 'The cockflung him-self in after the fish and took the shape of a pike,and for two hours they chased each other up and down under the water,uttering horrible cries, but we could see nothing', 'At length theyrose from the water in their proper forms, but darting such flamesof fire from their mouths that we dreaded lest the palace shouldcatch fire', 'Soon, however, we had much greater cause for alarm,as the genius, having shaken off the princess, flew towards us', 'Our fate would have been sealed if the princess, seeing our danger,had not attracted the attention of the genius to herself', \"As it was,the Sultan's beard was singed and his face scorched, the chiefof the eunuchs was burned to a cinder, while a spark deprived meof the sight of one eye\", 'Both I and the Sultan had given up allhope of a rescue, when there was a shout of \"Victory, victory', '\"from the princess, and the genius lay at her feet a great heapof ashes', 'Exhausted though she was, the princess at once ordered the little slave,who alone was uninjured, to bring her a cup of water, which shetook in her hand', 'First repeating some magic words over it,she dashed it into my face saying, \"If you are only a monkeyby enchantment, resume the form of the man you were before', '\" In an instant I stood before her the same man I had formerly been,though having lost the sight of one eye', 'I was about to fall on my knees and thank the princess but she didnot give me time', 'Turning to the Sultan, her father, she said,\"Sire, I have gained the battle, but it has cost me dear', 'The firehas penetrated to my heart, and I have only a few moments to live', 'This would not have happened if I had only noticed the lastpomegranate seed and eaten it like the rest', 'It was the laststruggle of the genius, and up to that time I was quite safe', 'But having let this chance slip I was forced to resort to fire,and in spite of all his experience I showed the genius that Iknew more than he did', 'He is dead and in ashes, but my owndeath is approaching fast', '\"  \"My daughter,\" cried the Sultan,\"how sad is my condition', 'I am only surprised I am alive at all', 'The eunuch is consumed by the flames, and the prince whom you havedelivered has lost the sight of one eye', '\"  He could say no more,for sobs choked his voice, and we all wept together', 'Suddenly the princess shrieked, \"I burn, I burn', '\" and death cameto free her from her torments', 'I have no words, madam, to tell you of my feelings at thisterrible sight', 'I would rather have remained a monkey all mylife than let my benefactress perish in this shocking manner', 'As for the Sultan, he was quite inconsolable, and his subjects,who had dearly loved the princess, shared his grief', 'For sevendays the whole nation mourned, and then the ashes of the princesswere buried with great pomp, and a superb tomb was raised over her', 'As soon as the Sultan recovered from the severe illness whichhad seized him after the death of the princess he sent for meand plainly, though politely, informed me that my presence wouldalways remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would instantlyquit his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it', 'I was,of course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of meI shaved my beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender', 'After wandering aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to cometo Bagdad and request an audience of the Commander of the Faithful', 'And that, madam, is my story', 'The other Calender then told his story', 'Story of the Third Calendar, Son of a KingMy story, said the Third Calender, is quite different from thoseof my two friends', 'It was fate that deprived them of the sightof their right eyes, but mine was lost by my own folly', 'My name is Agib, and I am the son of a king called Cassib,who reigned over a large kingdom, which had for its capitalone of the finest seaport towns in the world', \"When I succeeded to my father's throne my first care was to visitthe provinces on the mainland, and then to sail to the numerousislands which lay off the shore, in order to gain the heartsof my subjects\", 'These voyages gave me such a taste for sailingthat I soon determined to explore more distant seas, and commandeda fleet of large ships to be got ready without delay', 'When theywere properly fitted out I embarked on my expedition', 'For forty days wind and weather were all in our favour, but thenext night a terrific storm arose, which blew us hither and thitherfor ten days, till the pilot confessed that he had quite losthis bearings', 'Accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead to tryto catch a sight of land, and reported that nothing was to be seenbut the sea and sky, except a huge mass of blackness that lay astern', 'On hearing this the pilot grew white, and, beating his breast,he cried, \"Oh, sir, we are lost, lost', '\" till the ship\\'s crew trembledat they knew not what', 'When he had recovered himself a little,and was able to explain the cause of his terror, he replied,in answer to my question, that we had drifted far out of our course,and that the following day about noon we should come near that massof darkness, which, said he, is nothing but the famous Black Mountain', 'This mountain is composed of adamant, which attracts to itselfall the iron and nails in your ship; and as we are helplesslydrawn nearer, the force of attraction will become so great that theiron and nails will fall out of the ships and cling to the mountain,and the ships will sink to the bottom with all that are in them', 'This it is that causes the side of the mountain towards the sea toappear of such a dense blackness', 'As may be supposed--continued the pilot--the mountain sidesare very rugged, but on the summit stands a brass dome supportedon pillars, and bearing on top the figure of a brass horse,with a rider on his back', 'This rider wears a breastplate of lead,on which strange signs and figures are engraved, and it is saidthat as long as this statue remains on the dome, vessels willnever cease to perish at the foot of the mountain', 'So saying, the pilot began to weep afresh, and the crew, fearing theirlast hour had come, made their wills, each one in favour of his fellow', 'At noon next day, as the pilot had foretold, we were so near to theBlack Mountain that we saw all the nails and iron fly out of the shipsand dash themselves against the mountain with a horrible noise', 'A moment after the vessels fell asunder and sank, the crews with them', 'I alone managed to grasp a floating plank, and was driven ashoreby the wind, without even a scratch', 'What was my joy on findingmyself at the bottom of some steps which led straight up the mountain,for there was not another inch to the right or the left where a mancould set his foot', 'And, indeed, even the steps themselves wereso narrow and so steep that, if the lightest breeze had arisen,I should certainly have been blown into the sea', 'When I reached the top I found the brass dome and the statue exactlyas the pilot had described, but was too wearied with all I hadgone through to do more than glance at them, and, flinging myselfunder the dome, was asleep in an instant', 'In my dreams an old manappeared to me and said, \"Hearken, Agib', 'As soon as thou art awakedig up the ground underfoot, and thou shalt find a bow of brass andthree arrows of lead', 'Shoot the arrows at the statue, and the ridershall tumble into the sea, but the horse will fall down by thy side,and thou shalt bury him in the place from which thou tookest the bowand arrows', 'This being done the sea will rise and cover the mountain,and on it thou wilt perceive the figure of a metal man seatedin a boat, having an oar in each hand', 'Step on board and lethim conduct thee; but if thou wouldest behold thy kingdom again,see that thou takest not the name of Allah into thy mouth', '\"Having uttered these words the vision left me, and I woke,much comforted', 'I sprang up and drew the bow and arrows out ofthe ground, and with the third shot the horseman fell with a greatcrash into the sea, which instantly began to rise, so rapidly, that Ihad hardly time to bury the horse before the boat approached me', 'I stepped silently in and sat down, and the metal man pushed off,and rowed without stopping for nine days, after which land appearedon the horizon', 'I was so overcome with joy at this sight that Iforgot all the old man had told me, and cried out, \"Allah be praised', 'Allah be praised', '\"The words were scarcely out of my mouth when the boat and mansank from beneath me, and left me floating on the surface', 'All that day and the next night I swam and floated alternately,making as well as I could for the land which was nearest to me', 'At last my strength began to fail, and I gave myself up for lost,when the wind suddenly rose, and a huge wave cast me on a flat shore', 'Then, placing myself in safety, I hastily spread my clothes out to dryin the sun, and flung myself on the warm ground to rest', 'Next morning I dressed myself and began to look about me', 'There seemed to be no one but myself on the island, which was coveredwith fruit trees and watered with streams, but seemed a long distancefrom the mainland which I hoped to reach', 'Before, however, I hadtime to feel cast down, I saw a ship making directly for the island,and not knowing whether it would contain friends or foes, I hidmyself in the thick branches of a tree', 'The sailors ran the ship into a creek, where ten slaves landed,carrying spades and pickaxes', 'In the middle of the island they stopped,and after digging some time, lifted up what seemed to be a trapdoor', 'They then returned to the vessel two or three times for furnitureand provisions, and finally were accompanied by an old man,leading a handsome boy of fourteen or fifteen years of age', 'They all disappeared down the trapdoor, and after remaining belowfor a few minutes came up again, but without the boy, and letdown the trapdoor, covering it with earth as before', 'This done,they entered the ship and set sail', 'As soon as they were out of sight, I came down from my tree,and went to the place where the boy had been buried', 'I dug upthe earth till I reached a large stone with a ring in the centre', 'This, when removed, disclosed a flight of stone steps which ledto a large room richly furnished and lighted by tapers', 'On a pileof cushions, covered with tapestry, sat the boy', 'He looked up,startled and frightened at the sight of a stranger in such a place,and to soothe his fears, I at once spoke:  \"Be not alarmed, sir,whoever you may be', 'I am a king, and the son of a king, and willdo you no hurt', 'On the contrary, perhaps I have been sent hereto deliver you out of this tomb, where you have been buried alive', '\"Hearing my words, the young man recovered himself, and when I had ended,he said, \"The reasons, Prince, that have caused me to be buriedin this place are so strange that they cannot but surprise you', 'My father is a rich merchant, owning much land and many ships,and has great dealings in precious stones, but he never ceasedmourning that he had no child to inherit his wealth', '\"\"At length one day he dreamed that the following year a son wouldbe born to him, and when this actually happened, he consultedall the wise men in the kingdom as to the future of the infant', 'One and all they said the same thing', 'I was to live happilytill I was fifteen, when a terrible danger awaited me, which Ishould hardly escape', 'If, however, I should succeed in doing so,I should live to a great old age', 'And, they added, when the statueof the brass horse on the top of the mountain of adamant is throwninto the sea by Agib, the son of Cassib, then beware, for fifty dayslater your son shall fall by his hand', '\"\"This prophecy struck the heart of my father with such woe, that henever got over it, but that did not prevent him from attendingcarefully to my education till I attained, a short time ago,my fifteenth birthday', 'It was only yesterday that the newsreached him that ten days previously the statue of brass had beenthrown into the sea, and he at once set about hiding me in thisunderground chamber, which was built for the purpose, promising tofetch me out when the forty days have passed', 'For myself, I haveno fears, as Prince Agib is not likely to come here to look for me', '\"I listened to his story with an inward laugh as to the absurdity of myever wishing to cause the death of this harmless boy, whom I hastenedto assure of my friendship and even of my protection; begging him,in return, to convey me in his father\\'s ship to my own country', 'I need hardly say that I took special care not to inform him that Iwas the Agib whom he dreaded', 'The day passed in conversation on various subjects, and I found hima youth of ready wit and of some learning', 'I took on myself theduties of a servant, held the basin and water for him when he washed,prepared the dinner and set it on the table', 'He soon grew to love me,and for thirty-nine days we spent as pleasant an existence as couldbe expected underground', 'The morning of the fortieth dawned, and the young man when he wokegave thanks in an outburst of joy that the danger was passed', '\"My father may be here at any moment,\" said he, \"so make me, I pray you,a bath of hot water, that I may bathe, and change my clothes,and be ready to receive him', '\"So I fetched the water as he asked, and washed and rubbed him,after which he lay down again and slept a little', 'When he openedhis eyes for the second time, he begged me to bring him a melonand some sugar, that he might eat and refresh himself', 'I soon chose a fine melon out of those which remained, but couldfind no knife to cut it with', '\"Look in the cornice over my head,\"said he, \"and I think you will see one', '\"  It was so high above me,that I had some difficulty in reaching it, and catching my foot in thecovering of the bed, I slipped, and fell right upon the young man,the knife going straight into his heart', 'At this awful sight I shrieked aloud in my grief and pain', 'I threw myself on the ground and rent my clothes and tore my hairwith sorrow', 'Then, fearing to be punished as his murderer by theunhappy father, I raised the great stone which blocked the staircase,and quitting the underground chamber, made everything fast as before', 'Scarcely had I finished when, looking out to sea, I saw the vesselheading for the island, and, feeling that it would be uselessfor me to protest my innocence, I again concealed myself amongthe branches of a tree that grew near by', 'The old man and his slaves pushed off in a boat directly the shiptouched land, and walked quickly towards the entrance to theunderground chamber; but when they were near enough to see thatthe earth had been disturbed, they paused and changed colour', 'In silence they all went down and called to the youth by name;then for a moment I heard no more', 'Suddenly a fearful screamrent the air, and the next instant the slaves came up the steps,carrying with them the body of the old man, who had fainted from sorrow', 'Laying him down at the foot of the tree in which I had taken shelter,they did their best to recover him, but it took a long while', \"When at last he revived, they left him to dig a grave, and then layingthe young man's body in it, they threw in the earth\", 'This ended, the slaves brought up all the furniture that remained below,and put it on the vessel, and breaking some boughs to weavea litter, they laid the old man on it, and carried him to the ship,which spread its sails and stood out to sea', 'So once more I was quite alone, and for a whole month I walked dailyover the island, seeking for some chance of escape', 'At lengthone day it struck me that my prison had grown much larger, and thatthe mainland seemed to be nearer', 'My heart beat at this thought,which was almost too good to be true', 'I watched a little longer: there was no doubt about it, and soon there was only a tiny streamfor me to cross', 'Even when I was safe on the other side I had a long distance to goon the mud and sand before I reached dry ground, and very tired I was,when far in front of me I caught sight of a castle of red copper,which, at first sight, I took to be a fire', 'I made all the hasteI could, and after some miles of hard walking stood before it,and gazed at it in astonishment, for it seemed to me the most wonderfulbuilding I had ever beheld', 'While I was still staring at it,there came towards me a tall old man, accompanied by ten young men,all handsome, and all blind of the right eye', 'Now in its way, the spectacle of ten men walking together, all blindof the right eye, is as uncommon as that of a copper castle, and I wasturning over in my mind what could be the meaning of this strange fact,when they greeted me warmly, and inquired what had brought me there', 'I replied that my story was somewhat long, but that if they wouldtake the trouble to sit down, I should be happy to tell it them', 'When I had finished, the young men begged that I would gowith them to the castle, and I joyfully accepted their offer', 'We passed through what seemed to me an endless number of rooms,and came at length into a large hall, furnished with ten smallblue sofas for the ten young men, which served as beds as wellas chairs, and with another sofa in the middle for the old man', 'As none of the sofas could hold more than one person, they bade meplace myself on the carpet, and to ask no questions about anything Ishould see', 'After a little while the old man rose and brought in supper, which Iate heartily, for I was very hungry', 'Then one of the young men beggedme to repeat my story, which had struck them all with astonishment,and when I had ended, the old man was bidden to \"do his duty,\"as it was late, and they wished to go to bed', 'At these wordshe rose, and went to a closet, from which he brought out ten basins,all covered with blue stuff', 'He set one before each of the young men,together with a lighted taper', 'When the covers were taken off the basins, I saw they were filledwith ashes, coal-dust, and lamp-black', 'The young men mixed theseall together, and smeared the whole over their heads and faces', 'They then wept and beat their breasts, crying, \"This is the fruitof idleness, and of our wicked lives', '\"This ceremony lasted nearly the whole night, and when it stoppedthey washed themselves carefully, and put on fresh clothes,and lay down to sleep', 'All this while I had refrained from questions, though my curiosityalmost seemed to burn a hole in me, but the following day, when we wentout to walk, I said to them, \"Gentlemen, I must disobey your wishes,for I can keep silence no more', 'You do not appear to lack wit,yet you do such actions as none but madmen could be capable of', 'Whatever befalls me I cannot forbear asking, \"Why you daub yourfaces with black, and how it is you are all blind of one eye', '\" But they only answered that such questions were none of my business,and that I should do well to hold my peace', '\"During that day we spoke of other things, but when night came,and the same ceremony was repeated, I implored them most earnestlyto let me know the meaning of it all', '\"It is for your own sake,\" replied one of the young men, \"that we havenot granted your request, and to preserve you from our unfortunate fate', 'If, however, you wish to share our destiny we will delay no longer', '\"I answered that whatever might be the consequence I wished to havemy curiosity satisfied, and that I would take the result on myown head', 'He then assured me that, even when I had lost my eye,I should be unable to remain with them, as their number was complete,and could not be added to', 'But to this I replied that, though Ishould be grieved to part company with such honest gentlemen,I would not be turned from my resolution on that account', 'On hearing my determination my ten hosts then took a sheep andkilled it, and handed me a knife, which they said I should by-and-byfind useful', '\"We must sew you into this sheep-skin,\" said they,\"and then leave you', 'A fowl of monstrous size, called a roc,will appear in the air, taking you to be a sheep', 'He will snatchyou up and carry you into the sky, but be not alarmed, for hewill bring you safely down and lay you on the top of a mountain', 'When you are on the ground cut the skin with the knife and throwit off', 'As soon as the roc sees you he will fly away from fear,but you must walk on till you come to a castle covered withplates of gold, studded with jewels', 'Enter boldly at the gate,which always stands open, but do not ask us to tell you what wesaw or what befel us there, for that you will learn for yourself', 'This only we may say, that it cost us each our right eye, and hasimposed upon us our nightly penance', '\"After the young gentlemen had been at the trouble of sewingthe sheep-skin on me they left me, and retired to the hall', 'In a few minutes the roc appeared, and bore me off to thetop of the mountain in his huge claws as lightly as if Ihad been a feather, for this great white bird is so strongthat he has been known to carry even an elephant to his nest in the hills', 'The moment my feet touched the ground I took out my knife and cutthe threads that bound me, and the sight of me in my proper clothesso alarmed the roc that he spread his wings and flew away', 'Then I set out to seek the castle', 'I found it after wandering about for half a day, and never could Ihave imagined anything so glorious', 'The gate led into a square court,into which opened a hundred doors, ninety-nine of them beingof rare woods and one of gold', 'Through each of these doorsI caught glimpses of splendid gardens or of rich storehouses', 'Entering one of the doors which was standing open I found myselfin a vast hall where forty young ladies, magnificently dressed,and of perfect beauty, were reclining', 'As soon as they sawme they rose and uttered words of welcome, and even forced meto take possession of a seat that was higher than their own,though my proper place was at their feet', 'Not content with this,one brought me splendid garments, while another filled a basinwith scented water and poured it over my hands, and the restbusied themselves with preparing refreshments', 'After I had eatenand drunk of the most delicate food and rarest wines, the ladiescrowded round me and begged me to tell them all my adventures', 'By the time I had finished night had fallen, and the ladies lightedup the castle with such a prodigious quantity of tapers that even daycould hardly have been brighter', 'We then sat down to a supper of driedfruits and sweetmeats, after which some sang and others danced', 'I was so well amused that I did not notice how the time was passing,but at length one of the ladies approached and informed me itwas midnight, and that, as I must be tired, she would conductme to the room that had been prepared for me', 'Then, bidding megood-night, I was left to sleep', 'I spent the next thirty-nine days in much the same way as the first,but at the close of that time the ladies appeared (as was their custom)in my room one morning to inquire how I had slept, and insteadof looking cheerful and smiling they were in floods of tears', '\"Prince,\" said they, \"we must leave you, and never was it so hardto part from any of our friends', 'Most likely we shall never seeyou again, but if you have sufficient self-command perhaps we may yetlook forward to a meeting', '\"\"Ladies,\" I replied, \"what is the meaning of these strange words--I pray you to tell me', '\"\"Know then,\" answered one of them, \"that we are all princesses--each a king\\'s daughter', 'We live in this castle together, in the waythat you have seen, but at the end of every year secret dutiescall us away for the space of forty days', 'The time has now come;but before we depart, we will leave you our keys, so that youmay not lack entertainment during our absence', 'But one thingwe would ask of you', 'The Golden Door, alone, forbear to open,as you value your own peace, and the happiness of your life', 'That door once unlocked, we must bid you farewell for ever', '\"Weeping, I assured them of my prudence, and after embracingme tenderly, they went their ways', 'Every day I opened two or three fresh doors, each of whichcontained behind it so many curious things that I had no chanceof feeling dull, much as I regretted the absence of the ladies', \"Sometimes it was an orchard, whose fruit far exceeded in bignessany that grew in my father's garden\", 'Sometimes it was a courtplanted with roses, jessamine, dafeodils, hyacinths and anemones,and a thousand other flowers of which I did not know the names', 'Or again, it would be an aviary, fitted with all kinds of singing birds,or a treasury heaped up with precious stones; but whatever I might see,all was perfect of its own sort', 'Thirty-nine days passed away more rapidly than I could haveconceived possible, and the following morning the princesses wereto return to the castle', 'But alas', 'I had explored every corner,save only the room that was shut in by the Golden Door, and Ihad no longer anything to amuse myself with', 'I stood before theforbidden place for some time, gazing at its beauty; then a happyinspiration struck me, that because I unlocked the door it was notnecessary that I should enter the chamber', 'It would be enoughfor me to stand outside and view whatever hidden wonders might be therein', 'Thus arguing against my own conscience, I turned the key, when a smellrushed out that, pleasant though it was, overcame me completely,and I fell fainting across the threshold', 'Instead of being warnedby this accident, directly I came to myself I went for a fewmoments into the air to shake of the effects of the perfume,and then entered boldly', 'I found myself in a large, vaulted room,lighted by tapers, scented with aloes and ambergris, standing in goldencandle-sticks, whilst gold and silver lamps hung from the ceiling', 'Though objects of rare workmanship lay heaped around me, I paid themscant attention, so much was I struck by a great black horse which stoodin one corner, the handsomest and best-shaped animal I had ever seen', 'His saddle and bridle were of massive gold, curiously wrought;one side of his trough was filled with clean barley and sesame,and the other with rose water', 'I led the animal into the open air,and then jumped on his back, shaking the reins as I did so, but as henever stirred, I touched him lightly with a switch I had picked upin his stable', 'No sooner did he feel the stroke, than he spreadhis wings (which I had not perceived before), and flew up with mestraight into the sky', 'When he had reached a prodigious height,he next darted back to earth, and alighted on the terrace belongingto a castle, shaking me violently out of the saddle as he did so,and giving me such a blow with his tail, that he knocked out myright eye', 'Half-stunned as I was with all that had happened to me, I roseto my feet, thinking as I did so of what had befallen the tenyoung men, and watching the horse which was soaring into the clouds', 'I left the terrace and wandered on till I came to a hall,which I knew to have been the one from which the roc had taken me,by the ten blue sofas against the wall', 'The ten young men were not present when I first entered, but camein soon after, accompanied by the old man', 'They greeted me kindly,and bewailed my misfortune, though, indeed, they had expectednothing less', '\"All that has happened to you,\" they said, \"we alsohave undergone, and we should be enjoying the same happiness still,had we not opened the Golden Door while the princesses were absent', 'You have been no wiser than we, and have suffered the same punishment', 'We would gladly receive you among us, to perform such penanceas we do, but we have already told you that this is impossible', 'Depart, therefore, from hence and go to the Court of Bagdad,where you shall meet with him that can decide your destiny', '\" They told me the way I was to travel, and I left them', \"On the road I caused my beard and eyebrows to be shaved, and puton a Calender's habit\", 'I have had a long journey, but arrived thisevening in the city, where I met my brother Calenders at the gate,being strangers like myself', 'We wondered much at one another,to see we were all blind of the same eye, but we had no leisureto discourse at length of our common calamities', 'We had only so muchtime as to come hither to implore those favours which you have beengenerously pleased to grant us', 'He finished, and it was Zobeida\\'s turn to speak:  \"Go whereveryou please,\" she said, addressing all three', '\"I pardon you all,but you must depart immediately out of this house', '\"The Seven Voyages of Sindbad the SailorIN the times of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid there lived in Bagdada poor porter named Hindbad, who on a very hot day was sentto carry a heavy load from one end of the city to the other', 'Before he had accomplished half the distance he was so tired that,finding himself in a quiet street where the pavement was sprinkledwith rose water, and a cool breeze was blowing, he set his burdenupon the ground, and sat down to rest in the shade of a grand house', 'Very soon he decided that he could not have chosen a pleasanter place;a delicious perfume of aloes wood and pastilles came from the openwindows and mingled with the scent of the rose water which steamedup from the hot pavement', 'Within the palace he heard some music,as of many instruments cunningly played, and the melodious warbleof nightingales and other birds, and by this, and the appetising smellof many dainty dishes of which he presently became aware, he judgedthat feasting and merry making were going on', 'He wondered who livedin this magnificent house which he had never seen before, the streetin which it stood being one which he seldom had occasion to pass', 'To satisfy his curiosity he went up to some splendidly dressed servantswho stood at the door, and asked one of them the name of the masterof the mansion', '\"What,\" replied he, \"do you live in Bagdad, and not know that herelives the noble Sindbad the Sailor, that famous traveller who sailedover every sea upon which the sun shines', '\"The porter, who had often heard people speak of the immense wealthof Sindbad, could not help feeling envious of one whose lot seemedto be as happy as his own was miserable', 'Casting his eyes upto the sky he exclaimed aloud,\"Consider, Mighty Creator of all things, the differences betweenSindbad\\'s life and mine', 'Every day I suffer a thousand hardshipsand misfortunes, and have hard work to get even enough bad barleybread to keep myself and my family alive, while the lucky Sindbadspends money right and left and lives upon the fat of the land', 'What has he done that you should give him this pleasant life--what have I done to deserve so hard a fate', '\"So saying he stamped upon the ground like one beside himself with miseryand despair', 'Just at this moment a servant came out of the palace,and taking him by the arm said, \"Come with me, the noble Sindbad,my master, wishes to speak to you', '\"Hindbad was not a little surprised at this summons, and feared that hisunguarded words might have drawn upon him the displeasure of Sindbad,so he tried to excuse himself upon the pretext that he could notleave the burden which had been entrusted to him in the street', 'However the lackey promised him that it should be taken care of,and urged him to obey the call so pressingly that at last the porterwas obliged to yield', 'He followed the servant into a vast room, where a great companywas seated round a table covered with all sorts of delicacies', 'In the place of honour sat a tall, grave man whose long whitebeard gave him a venerable air', 'Behind his chair stood a crowdof attendants eager to minister to his wants', 'This was the famousSindbad himself', 'The porter, more than ever alarmed at the sightof so much magnificence, tremblingly saluted the noble company', 'Sindbad, making a sign to him to approach, caused him to be seatedat his right hand, and himself heaped choice morsels upon his plate,and poured out for him a draught of excellent wine, and presently,when the banquet drew to a close, spoke to him familiarly, asking hisname and occupation', '\"My lord,\" replied the porter, \"I am called Hindbad', '\"\"I am glad to see you here,\" continued Sindbad', '\"And I will answerfor the rest of the company that they are equally pleased, but I wishyou to tell me what it was that you said just now in the street', '\" For Sindbad, passing by the open window before the feast began,had heard his complaint and therefore had sent for him', 'At this question Hindbad was covered with confusion, and hanging downhis head, replied, \"My lord, I confess that, overcome by weariness andill-humour, I uttered indiscreet words, which I pray you to pardon me', '\"\"Oh', '\" replied Sindbad, \"do not imagine that I am so unjust as to blameyou', 'On the contrary, I understand your situation and can pity you', 'Only you appear to be mistaken about me, and I wish to set you right', 'You doubtless imagine that I have acquired all the wealth and luxurythat you see me enjoy without difficulty or danger, but this is farindeed from being the case', 'I have only reached this happy stateafter having for years suffered every possible kind of toil and danger', '\"\"Yes, my noble friends,\" he continued, addressing the company,\"l assure you that my adventures have been strange enough to deter eventhe most avaricious men from seeking wealth by traversing the seas', 'Since you have, perhaps, heard but confused accounts of my seven voyages,and the dangers and wonders that I have met with by sea and land,I will now give you a full and true account of them, which I thinkyou will be well pleased to hear', '\"As Sindbad was relating his adventures chiefly on account ofthe porter, he ordered, before beginning his tale, that the burdenwhich had been left in the street should be carried by some of hisown servants to the place for which Hindbad had set out at first,while he remained to listen to the story', 'First VoyageI had inherited considerable wealth from my parents, and beingyoung and foolish I at first squandered it recklessly upon everykind of pleasure, but presently, finding that riches speedily taketo themselves wings if managed as badly as I was managing mine,and remembering also that to be old and poor is misery indeed,I began to bethink me of how I could make the best of what stillremained to me', 'I sold all my household goods by public auction,and joined a company of merchants who traded by sea, embarking withthem at Balsora in a ship which we had fitted out between us', 'We set sail and took our course towards the East Indies by thePersian Gulf, having the coast of Persia upon our left hand and uponour right the shores of Arabia Felix', 'I was at first much troubledby the uneasy motion of the vessel, but speedily recovered my health,and since that hour have been no more plagued by sea-sickness', 'From time to time we landed at various islands, where we sold orexchanged our merchandise, and one day, when the wind dropped suddenly,we found ourselves becalmed close to a small island like a green meadow,which only rose slightly above the surface of the water', 'Our sailswere furled, and the captain gave permission to all who wishedto land for a while and amuse themselves', 'I was among the number,but when after strolling about for some time we lighted a fireand sat down to enjoy the repast which we had brought with us,we were startled by a sudden and violent trembling of the island,while at the same moment those left upon the ship set up an outcrybidding us come on board for our lives, since what we had takenfor an island was nothing but the back of a sleeping whale', 'Those who were nearest to the boat threw themselves into it,others sprang into the sea, but before I could save myself the whaleplunged suddenly into the depths of the ocean, leaving me clingingto a piece of the wood which we had brought to make our fire', 'Meanwhile a breeze had sprung up, and in the confusion that ensuedon board our vessel in hoisting the sails and taking up those who werein the boat and clinging to its sides, no one missed me and I wasleft at the mercy of the waves', 'All that day I floated up and down,now beaten this way, now that, and when night fell I despaired formy life; but, weary and spent as I was, I clung to my frail support,and great was my joy when the morning light showed me that I haddrifted against an island', 'The cliffs were high and steep, but luckily for me some tree-rootsprotruded in places, and by their aid I climbed up at last,and stretched myself upon the turf at the top, where I lay,more dead than alive, till the sun was high in the heavens', 'By that time I was very hungry, but after some searching I cameupon some eatable herbs, and a spring of clear water, and muchrefreshed I set out to explore the island', 'Presently I reacheda great plain where a grazing horse was tethered, and as I stoodlooking at it I heard voices talking apparently underground, and ina moment a man appeared who asked me how I came upon the island', \"I told him my adventures, and heard in return that he was oneof the grooms of Mihrage, the king of the island, and that eachyear they came to feed their master's horses in this plain\", 'He took me to a cave where his companions were assembled, and when Ihad eaten of the food they set before me, they bade me think myselffortunate to have come upon them when I did, since they were goingback to their master on the morrow, and without their aid I couldcertainly never have found my way to the inhabited part of the island', 'Early the next morning we accordingly set out, and when we reachedthe capital I was graciously received by the king, to whom I relatedmy adventures, upon which he ordered that I should be well caredfor and provided with such things as I needed', 'Being a merchantI sought out men of my own profession, and particularly thosewho came from foreign countries, as I hoped in this way to hearnews from Bagdad, and find out some means of returning thither,for the capital was situated upon the sea-shore, and visitedby vessels from all parts of the world', 'In the meantime I heardmany curious things, and answered many questions concerning myown country, for I talked willingly with all who came to me', 'Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little islandnamed Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposedto be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial', 'Indeed, the sailorsassured me that often at night the playing of timbals could beheard upon it', 'However, I saw nothing strange upon my voyage,saving some fish that were full two hundred cubits long, but werefortunately more in dread of us than even we were of them, and fledfrom us if we did but strike upon a board to frighten them', 'Other fishes there were only a cubit long which had heads like owls', 'One day after my return, as I went down to the quay, I saw a shipwhich had just cast anchor, and was discharging her cargo,while the merchants to whom it belonged were busily directingthe removal of it to their warehouses', 'Drawing nearer I presentlynoticed that my own name was marked upon some of the packages,and after having carefully examined them, I felt sure that theywere indeed those which I had put on board our ship at Balsora', 'I then recognised the captain of the vessel, but as I was certainthat he believed me to be dead, I went up to him and asked who ownedthe packages that I was looking at', '\"There was on board my ship,\" he replied, \"a merchant of Bagdadnamed Sindbad', 'One day he and several of my other passengerslanded upon what we supposed to be an island, but which wasreally an enormous whale floating asleep upon the waves', 'No sooner did it feel upon its back the heat of the fire whichhad been kindled, than it plunged into the depths of the sea', 'Several of the people who were upon it perished in the waters,and among others this unlucky Sindbad', 'This merchandise is his,but I have resolved to dispose of it for the benefit of his familyif I should ever chance to meet with them', '\"\"Captain,\" said I, \"I am that Sindbad whom you believe to be dead,and these are my possessions', '\"When the captain heard these words he cried out in amazement,\"Lackaday', 'and what is the world coming to', 'In these days thereis not an honest man to be met with', 'Did I not with my owneyes see Sindbad drown, and now you have the audacity to tellme that you are he', 'I should have taken you to be a just man,and yet for the sake of obtaining that which does not belong to you,you are ready to invent this horrible falsehood', '\"\"Have patience, and do me the favour to hear my story,\" said I', '\"Speak then,\" replied the captain, \"I\\'m all attention', '\"So I told him of my escape and of my fortunate meeting with theking\\'s grooms, and how kindly I had been received at the palace', 'Very soon I began to see that I had made some impression upon him,and after the arrival of some of the other merchants, who showedgreat joy at once more seeing me alive, he declared that he alsorecognised me', 'Throwing himself upon my neck he exclaimed, \"Heaven be praisedthat you have escaped from so great a danger', 'As to your goods,I pray you take them, and dispose of them as you please', '\" I thanked him, and praised his honesty, begging him to acceptseveral bales of merchandise in token of my gratitude, but hewould take nothing', 'Of the choicest of my goods I prepareda present for King Mihrage, who was at first amazed, having knownthat I had lost my all', 'However, when I had explained to himhow my bales had been miraculously restored to me, he graciouslyaccepted my gifts, and in return gave me many valuable things', 'I then took leave of him, and exchanging my merchandise for sandaland aloes wood, camphor, nutmegs, cloves, pepper, and ginger,I embarked upon the same vessel and traded so successfully uponour homeward voyage that I arrived in Balsora with about onehundred thousand sequins', 'My family received me with as much joyas I felt upon seeing them once more', 'I bought land and slaves,and built a great house in which I resolved to live happily, and inthe enjoyment of all the pleasures of life to forget my past sufferings', 'Here Sindbad paused, and commanded the musicians to play again,while the feasting continued until evening', 'When the time camefor the porter to depart, Sindbad gave him a purse containingone hundred sequins, saying, \"Take this, Hindbad, and go home,but to-morrow come again and you shall hear more of my adventures', '\"The porter retired quite overcome by so much generosity, and youmay imagine that he was well received at home, where his wife andchildren thanked their lucky stars that he had found such a benefactor', \"The next day Hindbad, dressed in his best, returned to thevoyager's house, and was received with open arms\", 'As soonas all the guests had arrived the banquet began as before,and when they had feasted long and merrily, Sindbad addressed them thus:\"My friends, I beg that you will give me your attention while Irelate the adventures of my second voyage, which you will findeven more astonishing than the first', '\"Second VoyageI had resolved, as you know, on my return from my first voyage,to spend the rest of my days quietly in Bagdad, but very soon I grewtired of such an idle life and longed once more to find myself uponthe sea', 'I procured, therefore, such goods as were suitable for the places Iintended to visit, and embarked for the second time in a good shipwith other merchants whom I knew to be honourable men', 'We went fromisland to island, often making excellent bargains, until one day welanded at a spot which, though covered with fruit trees and aboundingin springs of excellent water, appeared to possess neither housesnor people', 'While my companions wandered here and there gatheringflowers and fruit I sat down in a shady place, and, having heartilyenjoyed the provisions and the wine I had brought with me, Ifell asleep, lulled by the murmur of a clear brook which flowed close by', 'How long I slept I know not, but when I opened my eyes and startedto my feet I perceived with horror that I was alone and thatthe ship was gone', 'I rushed to and fro like one distracted,uttering cries of despair, and when from the shore I saw the vesselunder full sail just disappearing upon the horizon, I wishedbitterly enough that I had been content to stay at home in safety', 'But since wishes could do me no good, I presently took courageand looked about me for a means of escape', 'When I had climbeda tall tree I first of all directed my anxious glances towardsthe sea; but, finding nothing hopeful there, I turned landward,and my curiosity was excited by a huge dazzling white object,so far off that I could not make out what it might be', 'Descending from the tree I hastily collected what remained of myprovisions and set off as fast as I could go towards it', 'As I drewnear it seemed to me to be a white ball of immense size and height,and when I could touch it, I found it marvellously smooth and soft', 'As it was impossible to climb it--for it presented no foot-hold--I walked round about it seeking some opening, but there was none', 'I counted, however, that it was at least fifty paces round', 'By this time the sun was near setting, but quite suddenly itfell dark, something like a huge black cloud came swiftly over me,and I saw with amazement that it was a bird of extraordinary sizewhich was hovering near', 'Then I remembered that I had oftenheard the sailors speak of a wonderful bird called a roc, and itoccurred to me that the white object which had so puzzled me must beits egg', \"Sure enough the bird settled slowly down upon it, covering itwith its wings to keep it warm, and I cowered close beside the eggin such a position that one of the bird's feet, which was as largeas the trunk of a tree, was just in front of me\", 'Taking off my turbanI bound myself securely to it with the linen in the hope that the roc,when it took flight next morning, would bear me away with it fromthe desolate island', 'And this was precisely what did happen', 'As soon as the dawn appeared the bird rose into the air carryingme up and up till I could no longer see the earth, and thensuddenly it descended so swiftly that I almost lost consciousness', 'When I became aware that the roc had settled and that I was onceagain upon solid ground, I hastily unbound my turban from its footand freed myself, and that not a moment too soon; for the bird,pouncing upon a huge snake, killed it with a few blows from itspowerful beak, and seizing it up rose into the air once more andsoon disappeared from my view', 'When I had looked about me I beganto doubt if I had gained anything by quitting the desolate island', 'The valley in which I found myself was deep and narrow, and surroundedby mountains which towered into the clouds, and were so steepand rocky that there was no way of climbing up their sides', 'As I wandered about, seeking anxiously for some means of escapingfrom this trap, I observed that the ground was strewed with diamonds,some of them of an astonishing size', 'This sight gave me great pleasure,but my delight was speedily damped when I saw also numbers of horriblesnakes so long and so large that the smallest of them could haveswallowed an elephant with ease', 'Fortunately for me they seemedto hide in caverns of the rocks by day, and only came out by night,probably because of their enemy the roc', 'All day long I wandered up and down the valley, and when it grew duskI crept into a little cave, and having blocked up the entrance to itwith a stone, I ate part of my little store of food and lay downto sleep, but all through the night the serpents crawled to and fro,hissing horribly, so that I could scarcely close my eyes for terror', 'I was thankful when the morning light appeared, and when I judgedby the silence that the serpents had retreated to their dens I cametremblingly out of my cave and wandered up and down the valleyonce more, kicking the diamonds contemptuously out of my path, for Ifelt that they were indeed vain things to a man in my situation', 'At last, overcome with weariness, I sat down upon a rock, but I hadhardly closed my eyes when I was startled by something which fellto the ground with a thud close beside me', 'It was a huge piece of fresh meat, and as I stared at it severalmore pieces rolled over the cliffs in different places', \"I hadalways thought that the stories the sailors told of the famousvalley of diamonds, and of the cunning way which some merchants haddevised for getting at the precious stones, were mere travellers'tales invented to give pleasure to the hearers, but now I perceivedthat they were surely true\", 'These merchants came to the valleyat the time when the eagles, which keep their eyries in the rocks,had hatched their young', 'The merchants then threw great lumpsof meat into the valley', 'These, falling with so much force uponthe diamonds, were sure to take up some of the precious stoneswith them, when the eagles pounced upon the meat and carried it offto their nests to feed their hungry broods', 'Then the merchants,scaring away the parent birds with shouts and outcries, would securetheir treasures', 'Until this moment I had looked upon the valleyas my grave, for I had seen no possibility of getting out of it alive,but now I took courage and began to devise a means of escape', 'I began by picking up all the largest diamonds I could find and storingthem carefully in the leathern wallet which had held my provisions;this I tied securely to my belt', 'I then chose the piece of meatwhich seemed most suited to my purpose, and with the aid of my turbanbound it firmly to my back; this done I laid down upon my faceand awaited the coming of the eagles', 'I soon heard the flappingof their mighty wings above me, and had the satisfaction of feelingone of them seize upon my piece of meat, and me with it, and riseslowly towards his nest, into which he presently dropped me', 'Luckily for me the merchants were on the watch, and setting up theirusual outcries they rushed to the nest scaring away the eagle', 'Their amazement was great when they discovered me, and alsotheir disappointment, and with one accord they fell to abusing mefor having robbed them of their usual profit', 'Addressing myselfto the one who seemed most aggrieved, I said:  \"I am sure, if you knewall that I have suffered, you would show more kindness towards me,and as for diamonds, I have enough here of the very best for youand me and all your company', '\"  So saying I showed them to him', 'The others all crowded round me, wondering at my adventuresand admiring the device by which I had escaped from the valley,and when they had led me to their camp and examined my diamonds,they assured me that in all the years that they had carried on theirtrade they had seen no stones to be compared with them for sizeand beauty', 'I found that each merchant chose a particular nest, and took hischance of what he might find in it', 'So I begged the one who ownedthe nest to which I had been carried to take as much as he wouldof my treasure, but he contented himself with one stone, and that byno means the largest, assuring me that with such a gem his fortunewas made, and he need toil no more', 'I stayed with the merchantsseveral days, and then as they were journeying homewards I gladlyaccompanied them', 'Our way lay across high mountains infestedwith frightful serpents, but we had the good luck to escape themand came at last to the seashore', 'Thence we sailed to the isleof Rohat where the camphor trees grow to such a size that a hundredmen could shelter under one of them with ease', 'The sap flowsfrom an incision made high up in the tree into a vessel hung thereto receive it, and soon hardens into the substance called camphor,but the tree itself withers up and dies when it has been so treated', 'In this same island we saw the rhinoceros, an animal which is smallerthan the elephant and larger than the buffalo', 'It has one hornabout a cubit long which is solid, but has a furrow from the baseto the tip', 'Upon it is traced in white lines the figure of a man', 'The rhinoceros fights with the elephant, and transfixing himwith his horn carries him off upon his head, but becoming blindedwith the blood of his enemy, he falls helpless to the ground,and then comes the roc, and clutches them both up in his talonsand takes them to feed his young', 'This doubtless astonishes you,but if you do not believe my tale go to Rohat and see for yourself', 'For fear of wearying you I pass over in silence many other wonderfulthings which we saw in this island', 'Before we left I exchangedone of my diamonds for much goodly merchandise by which I profitedgreatly on our homeward way', 'At last we reached Balsora, whence Ihastened to Bagdad, where my first action was to bestow large sumsof money upon the poor, after which I settled down to enjoy tranquillythe riches I had gained with so much toil and pain', 'Having thus related the adventures of his second voyage, Sindbad againbestowed a hundred sequins upon Hindbad, inviting him to come againon the following day and hear how he fared upon his third voyage', 'The other guests also departed to their homes, but all returned atthe same hour next day, including the porter, whose former life of hardwork and poverty had already begun to seem to him like a bad dream', 'Again after the feast was over did Sindbad claim the attentionof his guests and began the account of his third voyage', 'Third VoyageAfter a very short time the pleasant easy life I led made me quiteforget the perils of my two voyages', 'Moreover, as I was stillin the prime of life, it pleased me better to be up and doing', 'So once more providing myself with the rarest and choicestmerchandise of Bagdad, I conveyed it to Balsora, and set sailwith other merchants of my acquaintance for distant lands', 'We had touched at many ports and made much profit, when one dayupon the open sea we were caught by a terrible wind which blewus completely out of our reckoning, and lasting for several daysfinally drove us into harbour on a strange island', '\"I would rather have come to anchor anywhere than here,\"quoth our captain', '\"This island and all adjoining it are inhabited byhairy savages, who are certain to attack us, and whatever these dwarfs maydo we dare not resist, since they swarm like locusts, and if one of themis killed the rest will fall upon us, and speedily make an end of us', '\"These words caused great consternation among all the ship\\'s company,and only too soon we were to find out that the captain spoke truly', 'There appeared a vast multitude of hideous savages, not more thantwo feet high and covered with reddish fur', 'Throwing themselvesinto the waves they surrounded our vessel', \"Chattering meanwhilein a language we could not understand, and clutching at ropesand gangways, they swarmed up the ship's side with such speed andagility that they almost seemed to fly\", 'You may imagine the rage and terror that seized us as we watched them,neither daring to hinder them nor able to speak a word to deter themfrom their purpose, whatever it might be', 'Of this we were not left longin doubt', 'Hoisting the sails, and cutting the cable of the anchor,they sailed our vessel to an island which lay a little further off,where they drove us ashore; then taking possession of her, they madeoff to the place from which they had come, leaving us helpless upona shore avoided with horror by all mariners for a reason which youwill soon learn', 'Turning away from the sea we wandered miserably inland, finding as wewent various herbs and fruits which we ate, feeling that we mightas well live as long as possible though we had no hope of escape', 'Presently we saw in tho far distance what seemed to us to be asplendid palace, towards which we turned our weary steps, but when wereached it we saw that it was a castle, lofty, and strongly built', 'Pushing back the heavy ebony doors we entered the courtyard,but upon the threshold of the great hall beyond it we paused,frozen with horror, at the sight which greeted us', 'On oneside lay a huge pile of bones--human bones, and on the othernumberless spits for roasting', 'Overcome with despair we sanktrembling to the ground, and lay there without speech or motion', 'The sun was setting when a loud noise aroused us, the door ofthe hall was violently burst open and a horrible giant entered', 'He was as tall as a palm tree, and perfectly black, and had one eye,which flamed like a burning coal in the middle of his forehead', \"His teeth were long and sharp and grinned horribly, while his lowerlip hung down upon his chest, and he had ears like elephant's ears,which covered his shoulders, and nails like the claws of somefierce bird\", 'At this terrible sight our senses left us and we lay like dead men', 'When at last we came to ourselves the giant sat examining us attentivelywith his fearful eye', 'Presently when he had looked at us enough hecame towards us, and stretching out his hand took me by the backof the neck, turning me this way and that, but feeling that I wasmere skin and bone he set me down again and went on to the next,whom he treated in the same fashion; at last he came to the captain,and finding him the fattest of us all, he took him up in one handand stuck him upon a spit and proceeded to kindle a huge fireat which he presently roasted him', 'After the giant had supped helay down to sleep, snoring like the loudest thunder, while we layshivering with horror the whole night through, and when day brokehe awoke and went out, leaving us in the castle', 'When we believed him to be really gone we started up bemoaning ourhorrible fate, until the hall echoed with our despairing cries', 'Though we were many and our enemy was alone it did not occur to us tokill him, and indeed we should have found that a hard task, even if wehad thought of it, and no plan could we devise to deliver ourselves', 'So at last, submitting to our sad fate, we spent the day in wanderingup and down the island eating such fruits as we could find,and when night came we returned to the castle, having sought in vainfor any other place of shelter', 'At sunset the giant returned,supped upon one of our unhappy comrades, slept and snored till dawn,and then left us as before', 'Our condition seemed to us so frightfulthat several of my companions thought it would be better to leapfrom the cliffs and perish in the waves at once, rather than awaitso miserable an end; but I had a plan of escape which I now unfoldedto them, and which they at once agreed to attempt', '\"Listen, my brothers,\" I added', '\"You know that plenty of driftwoodlies along the shore', 'Let us make several rafts, and carry themto a suitable place', 'If our plot succeeds, we can wait patientlyfor the chance of some passing ship which would rescue us from thisfatal island', 'If it fails, we must quickly take to our rafts;frail as they are, we have more chance of saving our lives with themthan we have if we remain here', '\"All agreed with me, and we spent the day in building rafts,each capable of carrying three persons', 'At nightfall we returnedto the castle, and very soon in came the giant, and one more of ournumber was sacrificed', 'But the time of our vengeance was at hand', \"As soon as he had finished his horrible repast he lay down to sleepas before, and when we heard him begin to snore I, and nine of theboldest of my comrades, rose softly, and took each a spit, which wemade red-hot in the fire, and then at a given signal we plunged itwith one accord into the giant's eye, completely blinding him\", 'Uttering a terrible cry, he sprang to his feet clutching in alldirections to try to seize one of us, but we had all fled differentways as soon as the deed was done, and thrown ourselves flat uponthe ground in corners where he was not likely to touch us withhis feet', 'After a vain search he fumbled about till he found the door, and fledout of it howling frightfully', 'As for us, when he was gone we madehaste to leave the fatal castle, and, stationing ourselves besideour rafts, we waited to see what would happen', 'Our idea was that if,when the sun rose, we saw nothing of the giant, and no longerheard his howls, which still came faintly through the darkness,growing more and more distant, we should conclude that he was dead,and that we might safely stay upon the island and need not riskour lives upon the frail rafts', 'But alas', 'morning light showed usour enemy approaching us, supported on either hand by two giantsnearly as large and fearful as himself, while a crowd of othersfollowed close upon their heels', 'Hesitating no longer we clamberedupon our rafts and rowed with all our might out to sea', 'The giants,seeing their prey escaping them, seized up huge pieces of rock,and wading into the water hurled them after us with such goodaim that all the rafts except the one I was upon were swamped,and their luckless crews drowned, without our being able to doanything to help them', 'Indeed I and my two companions had all wecould do to keep our own raft beyond the reach of the giants,but by dint of hard rowing we at last gained the open sea', 'Here we were at the mercy of the winds and waves, which tossed usto and fro all that day and night, but the next morning we foundourselves near an island, upon which we gladly landed', 'There we found delicious fruits, and having satisfied our hunger wepresently lay down to rest upon the shore', 'Suddenly we were arousedby a loud rustling noise, and starting up, saw that it was causedby an immense snake which was gliding towards us over the sand', 'So swiftly it came that it had seized one of my comrades before he hadtime to fly, and in spite of his cries and struggles speedily crushedthe life out of him in its mighty coils and proceeded to swallow him', 'By this time my other companion and I were running for our livesto some place where we might hope to be safe from this new horror,and seeing a tall tree we climbed up into it, having first providedourselves with a store of fruit off the surrounding bushes', 'When night came I fell asleep, but only to be awakened once moreby the terrible snake, which after hissing horribly round the treeat last reared itself up against it, and finding my sleeping comradewho was perched just below me, it swallowed him also, and crawledaway leaving me half dead with terror', 'When the sun rose I crept down from the tree with hardly a hopeof escaping the dreadful fate which had over-taken my comrades;but life is sweet, and I determined to do all I could to save myself', 'All day long I toiled with frantic haste and collected quantitiesof dry brushwood, reeds and thorns, which I bound with faggots,and making a circle of them under my tree I piled them firmly one uponanother until I had a kind of tent in which I crouched like a mousein a hole when she sees the cat coming', 'You may imagine what afearful night I passed, for the snake returned eager to devour me,and glided round and round my frail shelter seeking an entrance', 'Every moment I feared that it would succeed in pushing aside someof the faggots, but happily for me they held together, and when itgrew light my enemy retired, baffled and hungry, to his den', 'As for me I was more dead than alive', 'Shaking with fright and halfsuffocated by the poisonous breath of the monster, I came out of mytent and crawled down to the sea, feeling that it would be better toplunge from the cliffs and end my life at once than pass such anothernight of horror', 'But to my joy and relief I saw a ship sailing by,and by shouting wildly and waving my turban I managed to attract theattention of her crew', 'A boat was sent to rescue me, and very soon I found myself on boardsurrounded by a wondering crowd of sailors and merchants eagerto know by what chance I found myself in that desolate island', 'After I had told my story they regaled me with the choicest foodthe ship afforded, and the captain, seeing that I was in rags,generously bestowed upon me one of his own coats', 'After sailingabout for some time and touching at many ports we came at last tothe island of Salahat, where sandal wood grows in great abundance', 'Here we anchored, and as I stood watching the merchants disembarkingtheir goods and preparing to sell or exchange them, the captain came upto me and said,\"I have here, brother, some merchandise belonging to a passengerof mine who is dead', 'Will you do me the favour to trade with it,and when I meet with his heirs I shall be able to give them the money,though it will be only just that you shall have a portion foryour trouble', '\"I consented gladly, for I did not like standing by idle', 'Whereupon hepointed the bales out to me, and sent for the person whose duty itwas to keep a list of the goods that were upon the ship', 'When thisman came he asked in what name the merchandise was to be registered', '\"In the name of Sindbad the Sailor,\" replied the captain', 'At this I was greatly surprised, but looking carefully at him Irecognised him to be the captain of the ship upon which I had mademy second voyage, though he had altered much since that time', 'As for him, believing me to be dead it was no wonder that he had notrecognised me', '\"So, captain,\" said I, \"the merchant who owned those bales wascalled Sindbad', '\"\"Yes,\" he replied', '\"He was so named', 'He belonged to Bagdad,and joined my ship at Balsora, but by mischance he was left behindupon a desert island where we had landed to fill up our water-casks,and it was not until four hours later that he was missed', 'By that time the wind had freshened, and it was impossible to putback for him', '\"\"You suppose him to have perished then', '\" said I', '\"Alas', 'yes,\" he answered', '\"Why, captain', '\"  I cried, \"look well at me', 'I am that Sindbadwho fell asleep upon the island and awoke to find himself abandoned', '\"The captain stared at me in amazement, but was presently convincedthat I was indeed speaking the truth, and rejoiced greatly at my escape', '\"I am glad to have that piece of carelessness off my conscienceat any rate,\" said he', '\"Now take your goods, and the profit Ihave made for you upon them, and may you prosper in future', '\"I took them gratefully, and as we went from one island to another Ilaid in stores of cloves, cinnamon, and other spices', 'In one placeI saw a tortoise which was twenty cubits long and as many broad,also a fish that was like a cow and had skin so thick that it wasused to make shields', 'Another I saw that was like a camel in shapeand colour', 'So by degrees we came back to Balsora, and I returnedto Bagdad with so much money that I could not myself count it,besides treasures without end', 'I gave largely to the poor,and bought much land to add to what I already possessed, and thusended my third voyage', 'When Sindbad had finished his story he gave another hundred sequinsto Hindbad, who then departed with the other guests, but next daywhen they had all reassembled, and the banquet was ended, their hostcontinued his adventures', 'Fourth VoyageRich and happy as I was after my third voyage, I could not makeup my mind to stay at home altogether', 'My love of trading,and the pleasure I took in anything that was new and strange,made me set my affairs in order, and begin my journey through someof the Persian provinces, having first sent off stores of goodsto await my coming in the different places I intended to visit', 'I took ship at a distant seaport, and for some time all went well,but at last, being caught in a violent hurricane, our vessel becamea total wreck in spite of all our worthy captain could do to save her,and many of our company perished in the waves', 'I, with a few others,had the good fortune to be washed ashore clinging to pieces of the wreck,for the storm had driven us near an island, and scrambling up beyondthe reach of the waves we threw ourselves down quite exhausted,to wait for morning', 'At daylight we wandered inland, and soon saw some huts, to which wedirected our steps', 'As we drew near their black inhabitants swarmedout in great numbers and surrounded us, and we were led to their houses,and as it were divided among our captors', 'I with five otherswas taken into a hut, where we were made to sit upon the ground,and certain herbs were given to us, which the blacks made signsto us to eat', 'Observing that they themselves did not touch them,I was careful only to pretend to taste my portion; but my companions,being very hungry, rashly ate up all that was set before them,and very soon I had the horror of seeing them become perfectly mad', 'Though they chattered incessantly I could not understand a wordthey said, nor did they heed when I spoke to them', 'The savagesnow produced large bowls full of rice prepared with cocoanut oil,of which my crazy comrades ate eagerly, but I only tasted a few grains,understanding clearly that the object of our captors was to fatten usspeedily for their own eating, and this was exactly what happened', 'My unlucky companions having lost their reason, felt neitheranxiety nor fear, and ate greedily all that was offered them', 'So they were soon fat and there was an end of them, but I grewleaner day by day, for I ate but little, and even that little did meno good by reason of my fear of what lay before me', 'However, as Iwas so far from being a tempting morsel, I was allowed to wanderabout freely, and one day, when all the blacks had gone off uponsome expedition leaving only an old man to guard me, I managedto escape from him and plunged into the forest, running fasterthe more he cried to me to come back, until I had completelydistanced him', 'For seven days I hurried on, resting only when the darkness stopped me,and living chiefly upon cocoanuts, which afforded me both meatand drink, and on the eighth day I reached the seashore and saw a partyof white men gathering pepper, which grew abundantly all about', 'Reassured by the nature of their occupation, I advanced towards themand they greeted me in Arabic, asking who I was and whence I came', 'My delight was great on hearing this familiar speech, and I willinglysatisfied their curiosity, telling them how I had been shipwrecked,and captured by the blacks', '\"But these savages devour men', '\" said they', '\"How did you escape', '\"  I repeated to them what I have just told you,at which they were mightily astonished', 'I stayed with them untilthey had collected as much pepper as they wished, and then theytook me back to their own country and presented me to their king,by whom I was hospitably received', 'To him also I had to relatemy adventures, which surprised him much, and when I had finished heordered that I should be supplied with food and raiment and treatedwith consideration', 'The island on which I found myself was full of people, and aboundedin all sorts of desirable things, and a great deal of trafficwent on in the capital, where I soon began to feel at homeand contented', 'Moreover, the king treated me with special favour,and in consequence of this everyone, whether at the court or inthe town, sought to make life pleasant to me', 'One thing I remarkedwhich I thought very strange; this was that, from the greatestto the least, all men rode their horses without bridle or stirrups', 'I one day presumed to ask his majesty why he did not use them,to which he replied, \"You speak to me of things of which I have neverbefore heard', '\"  This gave me an idea', 'I found a clever workman,and made him cut out under my direction the foundation of a saddle,which I wadded and covered with choice leather, adorning itwith rich gold embroidery', 'I then got a lock-smith to make mea bit and a pair of spurs after a pattern that I drew for him,and when all these things were completed I presented them to the kingand showed him how to use them', 'When I had saddled one of his horseshe mounted it and rode about quite delighted with the novelty,and to show his gratitude he rewarded me with large gifts', \"After this I had to make saddles for all the principal officersof the king's household, and as they all gave me rich presents Isoon became very wealthy and quite an important person in the city\", 'One day the king sent for me and said, \"Sindbad, I am going to aska favour of you', 'Both I and my subjects esteem you, and wishyou to end your days amongst us', 'Therefore I desire that youwill marry a rich and beautiful lady whom I will find for you,and think no more of your own country', '\"As the king\\'s will was law I accepted the charming bride he presentedto me, and lived happily with her', 'Nevertheless I had every intentionof escaping at the first opportunity, and going back to Bagdad', 'Things were thus going prosperously with me when it happened thatthe wife of one of my neighbours, with whom I had struck up quitea friendship, fell ill, and presently died', 'I went to his houseto offer my consolations, and found him in the depths of woe', '\"Heaven preserve you,\" said I, \"and send you a long life', '\"\"Alas', '\" he replied, \"what is the good of saying that when I havebut an hour left to live', '\"\"Come, come', '\" said I, \"surely it is not so bad as all that', 'I trust that you may be spared to me for many years', '\"\"I hope,\" answered he, \"that your life may be long, but as for me,all is finished', 'I have set my house in order, and to-day I shallbe buried with my wife', 'This has been the law upon our islandfrom the earliest ages--the living husband goes to the gravewith his dead wife, the living wife with her dead husband', 'So did our fathers, and so must we do', 'The law changes not,and all must submit to it', '\"As he spoke the friends and relations of the unhappy pair beganto assemble', 'The body, decked in rich robes and sparklingwith jewels, was laid upon an open bier, and the procession started,taking its way to a high mountain at some distance from the city,the wretched husband, clothed from head to foot in a black mantle,following mournfully', 'When the place of interment was reached the corpse was lowered,just as it was, into a deep pit', 'Then the husband, bidding farewellto all his friends, stretched him-self upon another bier, upon whichwere laid seven little loaves of bread and a pitcher of water, and healso was let down-down-down to the depths of the horrible cavern,and then a stone was laid over the opening, and the melancholycompany wended its way back to the city', 'You may imagine that I was no unmoved spectator of these proceedings;to all the others it was a thing to which they had been accustomedfrom their youth up; but I was so horrified that I could not helptelling the king how it struck me', '\"Sire,\" I said, \"I am more astonished than I can express to youat the strange custom which exists in your dominions of buryingthe living with the dead', 'In all my travels I have never beforemet with so cruel and horrible a law', '\"\"What would you have, Sindbad', '\" he replied', '\"It is the lawfor everybody', 'I myself should be buried with the Queen if shewere the first to die', '\"\"But, your Majesty,\" said I, \"dare I ask if this law appliesto foreigners also', '\"\"Why, yes,\" replied the king smiling, in what I could but considera very heartless manner, \"they are no exception to the rule if theyhave married in the country', '\"When I heard this I went home much cast down, and from that timeforward my mind was never easy', \"If only my wife's little fingerached I fancied she was going to die, and sure enough before verylong she fell really ill and in a few days breathed her last\", 'My dismay was great, for it seemed to me that to be buriedalive was even a worse fate than to be devoured by cannibals,nevertheless there was no escape', 'The body of my wife, arrayed inher richest robes and decked with all her jewels, was laid uponthe bier', 'I followed it, and after me came a great procession,headed by the king and all his nobles, and in this order we reachedthe fatal mountain, which was one of a lofty chain bordering the sea', 'Here I made one more frantic effort to excite the pity of the kingand those who stood by, hoping to save myself even at this last moment,but it was of no avail', 'No one spoke to me, they even appearedto hasten over their dreadful task, and I speedily found myselfdescending into the gloomy pit, with my seven loaves and pitcherof water beside me', 'Almost before I reached the bottom the stonewas rolled into its place above my head, and I was left to my fate', 'A feeble ray of light shone into the cavern through some chink,and when I had the courage to look about me I could see that Iwas in a vast vault, bestrewn with bones and bodies of the dead', 'I even fancied that I heard the expiring sighs of those who,like myself, had come into this dismal place alive', 'All in vaindid I shriek aloud with rage and despair, reproaching myself forthe love of gain and adventure which had brought me to such a pass,but at length, growing calmer, I took up my bread and water,and wrapping my face in my mantle I groped my way towards the endof the cavern, where the air was fresher', 'Here I lived in darkness and misery until my provisions were exhausted,but just as I was nearly dead from starvation the rock was rolled awayoverhead and I saw that a bier was being lowered into the cavern,and that the corpse upon it was a man', 'In a moment my mind was made up,the woman who followed had nothing to expect but a lingering death;I should be doing her a service if I shortened her misery', 'Therefore when she descended, already insensible from terror,I was ready armed with a huge bone, one blow from which left her dead,and I secured the bread and water which gave me a hope of life', 'Several times did I have recourse to this desperate expedient,and I know not how long I had been a prisoner when one day I fanciedthat I heard something near me, which breathed loudly', 'Turning tothe place from which the sound came I dimly saw a shadowy form whichfled at my movement, squeezing itself through a cranny in the wall', 'I pursued it as fast as I could, and found myself in a narrow crackamong the rocks, along which I was just able to force my way', 'I followed it for what seemed to me many miles, and at last sawbefore me a glimmer of light which grew clearer every moment untilI emerged upon the sea shore with a joy which I cannot describe', 'When I was sure that I was not dreaming, I realised that it wasdoubtless some little animal which had found its way into the cavernfrom the sea, and when disturbed had fled, showing me a means of escapewhich I could never have discovered for myself', 'I hastily surveyedmy surroundings, and saw that I was safe from all pursuit fromthe town', 'The mountains sloped sheer down to the sea, and there was no roadacross them', 'Being assured of this I returned to the cavern,and amassed a rich treasure of diamonds, rubies, emeralds, and jewelsof all kinds which strewed the ground', 'These I made up into bales,and stored them into a safe place upon the beach, and then waitedhopefully for the passing of a ship', 'I had looked out for two days,however, before a single sail appeared, so it was with muchdelight that I at last saw a vessel not very far from the shore,and by waving my arms and uttering loud cries succeeded in attractingthe attention of her crew', 'A boat was sent off to me, and in answerto the questions of the sailors as to how I came to be in sucha plight, I replied that I had been shipwrecked two days before,but had managed to scramble ashore with the bales which I pointedout to them', 'Luckily for me they believed my story, and withouteven looking at the place where they found me, took up my bundles,and rowed me back to the ship', 'Once on board, I soon saw that thecaptain was too much occupied with the difficulties of navigationto pay much heed to me, though he generously made me welcome,and would not even accept the jewels with which I offered to paymy passage', 'Our voyage was prosperous, and after visiting many lands,and collecting in each place great store of goodly merchandise,I found myself at last in Bagdad once more with unheard of richesof every description', 'Again I gave large sums of money to the poor,and enriched all the mosques in the city, after which I gave myself upto my friends and relations, with whom I passed my time in feastingand merriment', 'Here Sindbad paused, and all his hearers declared that the adventuresof his fourth voyage had pleased them better than anything theyhad heard before', 'They then took their leave, followed by Hindbad,who had once more received a hundred sequins, and with the rest hadbeen bidden to return next day for the story of the fifth voyage', 'When the time came all were in their places, and when they had eatenand drunk of all that was set before them Sindbad began his tale', 'Fifth VoyageNot even all that I had gone through could make me contented with aquiet life', 'I soon wearied of its pleasures, and longed for changeand adventure', 'Therefore I set out once more, but this time in a shipof my own, which I built and fitted out at the nearest seaport', 'I wished to be able to call at whatever port I chose, taking my own time;but as I did not intend carrying enough goods for a full cargo,I invited several merchants of different nations to join me', 'We set sail with the first favourable wind, and after a longvoyage upon the open seas we landed upon an unknown island whichproved to be uninhabited', \"We determined, however, to explore it,but had not gone far when we found a roc's egg, as large as the oneI had seen before and evidently very nearly hatched, for the beakof the young bird had already pierced the shell\", 'In spite of all Icould say to deter them, the merchants who were with me fell upon itwith their hatchets, breaking the shell, and killing the young roc', 'Then lighting a fire upon the ground they hacked morsels from the bird,and proceeded to roast them while I stood by aghast', 'Scarcely had they finished their ill-omened repast, when the airabove us was darkened by two mighty shadows', 'The captain of my ship,knowing by experience what this meant, cried out to us that the parentbirds were coming, and urged us to get on board with all speed', 'This we did, and the sails were hoisted, but before we had madeany way the rocs reached their despoiled nest and hovered about it,uttering frightful cries when they discovered the mangled remainsof their young one', 'For a moment we lost sight of them, and wereflattering ourselves that we had escaped, when they reappearedand soared into the air directly over our vessel, and we sawthat each held in its claws an immense rock ready to crush us', 'There was a moment of breathless suspense, then one bird loosedits hold and the huge block of stone hurtled through the air,but thanks to the presence of mind of the helmsman, who turnedour ship violently in another direction, it fell into the sea closebeside us, cleaving it asunder till we could nearly see the bottom', 'We had hardly time to draw a breath of relief before the other rockfell with a mighty crash right in the midst of our luckless vessel,smashing it into a thousand fragments, and crushing, or hurling intothe sea, passengers and crew', 'I myself went down with the rest,but had the good fortune to rise unhurt, and by holding on to a pieceof driftwood with one hand and swimming with the other I kept myselfafloat and was presently washed up by the tide on to an island', 'Its shores were steep and rocky, but I scrambled up safely and threwmyself down to rest upon the green turf', 'When I had somewhat recovered I began to examine the spot in which Ifound myself, and truly it seemed to me that I had reached a gardenof delights', 'There were trees everywhere, and they were ladenwith flowers and fruit, while a crystal stream wandered in and outunder their shadow', 'When night came I slept sweetly in a cosy nook,though the remembrance that I was alone in a strange land made mesometimes start up and look around me in alarm, and then I wishedheartily that I had stayed at home at ease', 'However, the morningsunlight restored my courage, and I once more wandered amongthe trees, but always with some anxiety as to what I might see next', 'I had penetrated some distance into the island when I saw an oldman bent and feeble sitting upon the river bank, and at first Itook him to be some ship-wrecked mariner like myself', 'Going upto him I greeted him in a friendly way, but he only nodded his headat me in reply', 'I then asked what he did there, and he made signsto me that he wished to get across the river to gather some fruit,and seemed to beg me to carry him on my back', 'Pitying his ageand feebleness, I took him up, and wading across the stream I bentdown that he might more easily reach the bank, and bade him get down', 'But instead of allowing himself to be set upon his feet (even now itmakes me laugh to think of it', '), this creature who had seemed to meso decrepit leaped nimbly upon my shoulders, and hooking his legsround my neck gripped me so tightly that I was well-nigh choked,and so overcome with terror that I fell insensible to the ground', 'When I recovered my enemy was still in his place, though he had releasedhis hold enough to allow me breathing space, and seeing me revivehe prodded me adroitly first with one foot and then with the other,until I was forced to get up and stagger about with him under the treeswhile he gathered and ate the choicest fruits', 'This went on all day,and even at night, when I threw myself down half dead with weariness,the terrible old man held on tight to my neck, nor did he failto greet the first glimmer of morning light by drumming upon mewith his heels, until I perforce awoke and resumed my dreary marchwith rage and bitterness in my heart', 'It happened one day that I passed a tree under which lay severaldry gourds, and catching one up I amused myself with scoopingout its contents and pressing into it the juice of severalbunches of grapes which hung from every bush', 'When it was fullI left it propped in the fork of a tree, and a few days later,carrying the hateful old man that way, I snatched at my gourd as Ipassed it and had the satisfaction of a draught of excellent wineso good and refreshing that I even forgot my detestable burden,and began to sing and caper', 'The old monster was not slow to perceive the effect which my draughthad produced and that I carried him more lightly than usual, so hestretched out his skinny hand and seizing the gourd first tastedits contents cautiously, then drained them to the very last drop', 'The wine was strong and the gourd capacious, so he also beganto sing after a fashion, and soon I had the delight of feelingthe iron grip of his goblin legs unclasp, and with one vigorouseffort I threw him to the ground, from which he never moved again', 'I was so rejoiced to have at last got rid of this uncanny old manthat I ran leaping and bounding down to the sea shore, where, by thegreatest good luck, I met with some mariners who had anchored offthe island to enjoy the delicious fruits, and to renew their supplyof water', 'They heard the story of my escape with amazement, saying, \"You fellinto the hands of the Old Man of the Sea, and it is a mercy that hedid not strangle you as he has everyone else upon whose shouldershe has managed to perch himself', 'This island is well known asthe scene of his evil deeds, and no merchant or sailor who landsupon it cares to stray far away from his comrades', '\"  After we hadtalked for a while they took me back with them on board their ship,where the captain received me kindly, and we soon set sail,and after several days reached a large and prosperous-lookingtown where all the houses were built of stone', 'Here we anchored,and one of the merchants, who had been very friendly to me onthe way, took me ashore with him and showed me a lodging set apartfor strange merchants', 'He then provided me with a large sack,and pointed out to me a party of others equipped in like manner', '\"Go with them,\" said he, \"and do as they do, but beware of losingsight of them, for if you strayed your life would be in danger', '\"With that he supplied me with provisions, and bade me farewell,and I set out with my new companions', 'I soon learnt that theobject of our expedition was to fill our sacks with cocoanuts,but when at length I saw the trees and noted their immense heightand the slippery smoothness of their slender trunks, I did not atall understand how we were to do it', 'The crowns of the cocoa-palmswere all alive with monkeys, big and little, which skipped fromone to the other with surprising agility, seeming to be curiousabout us and disturbed at our appearance, and I was at firstsurprised when my companions after collecting stones began to throwthem at the lively creatures, which seemed to me quite harmless', 'But very soon I saw the reason of it and joined them heartily,for the monkeys, annoyed and wishing to pay us back in our own coin,began to tear the nuts from the trees and cast them at us with angryand spiteful gestures, so that after very little labour our sackswere filled with the fruit which we could not otherwise have obtained', 'As soon as we had as many as we could carry we went back to the town,where my friend bought my share and advised me to continue the sameoccupation until I had earned money enough to carry me to my own country', 'This I did, and before long had amassed a considerable sum', 'Just then I heard that there was a trading ship ready to sail,and taking leave of my friend I went on board, carrying with mea goodly store of cocoanuts; and we sailed first to the islandswhere pepper grows, then to Comari where the best aloes woodis found, and where men drink no wine by an unalterable law', 'Here I exchanged my nuts for pepper and good aloes wood, and wenta-fishing for pearls with some of the other merchants, and my diverswere so lucky that very soon I had an immense number, and thosevery large and perfect', 'With all these treasures I came joyfullyback to Bagdad, where I disposed of them for large sums of money,of which I did not fail as before to give the tenth part to the poor,and after that I rested from my labours and comforted myself withall the pleasures that my riches could give me', \"Having thus ended his story, Sindbad ordered that one hundredsequins should be given to Hindbad, and the guests then withdrew;but after the next day's feast he began the account of his sixthvoyage as follows\", 'Sixth VoyageIt must be a marvel to you how, after having five times met withshipwreck and unheard of perils, I could again tempt fortune andrisk fresh trouble', 'I am even surprised myself when I look back,but evidently it was my fate to rove, and after a year of reposeI prepared to make a sixth voyage, regardless of the entreatiesof my friends and relations, who did all they could to keep meat home', 'Instead of going by the Persian Gulf, I travelleda considerable way overland, and finally embarked from a distantIndian port with a captain who meant to make a long voyage', 'And truly he did so, for we fell in with stormy weather which droveus completely out of our course, so that for many days neithercaptain nor pilot knew where we were, nor where we were going', 'When they did at last discover our position we had small groundfor rejoicing, for the captain, casting his turban upon the deckand tearing his beard, declared that we were in the most dangerousspot upon the whole wide sea, and had been caught by a current whichwas at that minute sweeping us to destruction', 'It was too true', 'In spite of all the sailors could do we were driven with frightfulrapidity towards the foot of a mountain, which rose sheer outof the sea, and our vessel was dashed to pieces upon the rocks atits base, not, however, until we had managed to scramble on shore,carrying with us the most precious of our possessions', 'When wehad done this the captain said to us:\"Now we are here we may as well begin to dig our graves at once,since from this fatal spot no shipwrecked mariner has ever returned', '\"This speech discouraged us much, and we began to lament over oursad fate', 'The mountain formed the seaward boundary of a large island,and the narrow strip of rocky shore upon which we stood was strewnwith the wreckage of a thousand gallant ships, while the bonesof the luckless mariners shone white in the sunshine, and weshuddered to think how soon our own would be added to the heap', 'All around, too, lay vast quantities of the costliest merchandise,and treasures were heaped in every cranny of the rocks, but allthese things only added to the desolation of the scene', 'It struckme as a very strange thing that a river of clear fresh water,which gushed out from the mountain not far from where we stood,instead of flowing into the sea as rivers generally do,turned off sharply, and flowed out of sight under a natural archwayof rock, and when I went to examine it more closely I found thatinside the cave the walls were thick with diamonds, and rubies,and masses of crystal, and the floor was strewn with ambergris', 'Here, then, upon this desolate shore we abandoned ourselves toour fate, for there was no possibility of scaling the mountain,and if a ship had appeared it could only have shared our doom', \"The first thing our captain did was to divide equally amongst usall the food we possessed, and then the length of each man's lifedepended on the time he could make his portion last\", 'I myself couldlive upon very little', 'Nevertheless, by the time I had buried the last of my companionsmy stock of provisions was so small that I hardly thought I shouldlive long enough to dig my own grave, which I set about doing,while I regretted bitterly the roving disposition which was alwaysbringing me into such straits, and thought longingly of all the comfortand luxury that I had left', 'But luckily for me the fancy took meto stand once more beside the river where it plunged out of sightin the depths of the cavern, and as I did so an idea struck me', 'This river which hid itself underground doubtless emerged againat some distant spot', 'Why should I not build a raft and trustmyself to its swiftly flowing waters', 'If I perished before Icould reach the light of day once more I should be no worse offthan I was now, for death stared me in the face, while there wasalways the possibility that, as I was born under a lucky star,I might find myself safe and sound in some desirable land', 'I decided at any rate to risk it, and speedily built myself a stoutraft of drift-wood with strong cords, of which enough and to sparelay strewn upon the beach', 'I then made up many packages of rubies,emeralds, rock crystal, ambergris, and precious stuffs, and boundthem upon my raft, being careful to preserve the balance, and thenI seated myself upon it, having two small oars that I had fashionedlaid ready to my hand, and loosed the cord which held it to the bank', 'Once out in the current my raft flew swiftly under the gloomy archway,and I found myself in total darkness, carried smoothly forwardby the rapid river', 'On I went as it seemed to me for many nightsand days', 'Once the channel became so small that I had a narrowescape of being crushed against the rocky roof, and after that Itook the precaution of lying flat upon my precious bales', 'Though I only ate what was absolutely necessary to keep myself alive,the inevitable moment came when, after swallowing my last morselof food, I began to wonder if I must after all die of hunger', 'Then, worn out with anxiety and fatigue, I fell into a deep sleep,and when I again opened my eyes I was once more in the light of day;a beautiful country lay before me, and my raft, which was tiedto the river bank, was surrounded by friendly looking black men', 'I rose and saluted them, and they spoke to me in return, but I couldnot understand a word of their language', 'Feeling perfectly bewilderedby my sudden return to life and light, I murmured to myself in Arabic,\"Close thine eyes, and while thou sleepest Heaven will change thyfortune from evil to good', '\"One of the natives, who understood this tongue, then came forward saying:\"My brother, be not surprised to see us; this is our land, and as wecame to get water from the river we noticed your raft floatingdown it, and one of us swam out and brought you to the shore', 'We have waited for your awakening; tell us now whence you comeand where you were going by that dangerous way', '\"I replied that nothing would please me better than to tell them,but that I was starving, and would fain eat something first', 'I was soon supplied with all I needed, and having satisfiedmy hunger I told them faithfully all that had befallen me', 'They were lost in wonder at my tale when it was interpreted to them,and said that adventures so surprising must be related to their kingonly by the man to whom they had happened', 'So, procuring a horse,they mounted me upon it, and we set out, followed by severalstrong men carrying my raft just as it was upon their shoulders', 'In this order we marched into the city of Serendib, where the nativespresented me to their king, whom I saluted in the Indian fashion,prostrating myself at his feet and kissing the ground; but themonarch bade me rise and sit beside him, asking first what wasmy name', '\"I am Sindbad,\" I replied, \"whom men call `the Sailor,\\' for Ihave voyaged much upon many seas', '\"\"And how come you here', '\" asked the king', 'I told my story, concealing nothing, and his surprise and delightwere so great that he ordered my adventures to be written in lettersof gold and laid up in the archives of his kingdom', 'Presently my raft was brought in and the bales opened in his presence,and the king declared that in all his treasury there were no suchrubies and emeralds as those which lay in great heaps before him', 'Seeing that he looked at them with interest, I ventured to say that Imyself and all that I had were at his disposal, but he answeredme smiling:\"Nay, Sindbad', 'Heaven forbid that I should covet your riches;I will rather add to them, for I desire that you shall not leavemy kingdom without some tokens of my good will', '\"  He then commandedhis officers to provide me with a suitable lodging at his expense,and sent slaves to wait upon me and carry my raft and my bales to mynew dwelling place', 'You may imagine that I praised his generosityand gave him grateful thanks, nor did I fail to present myselfdaily in his audience chamber, and for the rest of my time I amusedmyself in seeing all that was most worthy of attention in the city', 'The island of Serendib being situated on the equinoctial line,the days and nights there are of equal length', 'The chief cityis placed at the end of a beautiful valley, formed by the highestmountain in the world, which is in the middle of the island', 'I had the curiosity to ascend to its very summit, for this was theplace to which Adam was banished out of Paradise', 'Here are foundrubies and many precious things, and rare plants grow abundantly,with cedar trees and cocoa palms', 'On the seashore and at the mouthsof the rivers the divers seek for pearls, and in some valleysdiamonds are plentiful', 'After many days I petitioned the king that Imight return to my own country, to which he graciously consented', 'Moreover, he loaded me with rich gifts, and when I went to takeleave of him he entrusted me with a royal present and a letter tothe Commander of the Faithful, our sovereign lord, saying, \"I prayyou give these to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid, and assure him ofmy friendship', '\"I accepted the charge respectfully, and soon embarked uponthe vessel which the king himself had chosen for me', 'The king\\'sletter was written in blue characters upon a rare and preciousskin of yellowish colour, and these were the words of it: \"The King of the Indies, before whom walk a thousand elephants,who lives in a palace, of which the roof blazes with a hundredthousand rubies, and whose treasure house contains twenty thousanddiamond crowns, to the Caliph Haroun al Raschid sends greeting', 'Though the offering we present to you is unworthy of your notice,we pray you to accept it as a mark of the esteem and friendshipwhich we cherish for you, and of which we gladly send you this token,and we ask of you a like regard if you deem us worthy of it', 'Adieu, brother', '\"The present consisted of a vase carved from a single ruby,six inches high and as thick as my finger; this was filled withthe choicest pearls, large, and of perfect shape and lustre;secondly, a huge snake skin, with scales as large as a sequin,which would preserve from sickness those who slept upon it', 'Then quantities of aloes wood, camphor, and pistachio-nuts; and lastly,a beautiful slave girl, whose robes glittered with precious stones', \"After a long and prosperous voyage we landed at Balsora, and I madehaste to reach Bagdad, and taking the king's letter I presentedmyself at the palace gate, followed by the beautiful slave,and various members of my own family, bearing the treasure\", \"As soon as I had declared my errand I was conducted into thepresence of the Caliph, to whom, after I had made my obeisance,I gave the letter and the king's gift, and when he had examinedthem he demanded of me whether the Prince of Serendib was reallyas rich and powerful as he claimed to be\", '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" I replied, again bowing humbly before him,\"I can assure your Majesty that he has in no way exaggerated his wealthand grandeur', 'Nothing can equal the magnificence of his palace', 'When he goes abroad his throne is prepared upon the back of an elephant,and on either side of him ride his ministers, his favourites,and courtiers', \"On his elephant's neck sits an officer, his golden lancein his hand, and behind him stands another bearing a pillar of gold,at the top of which is an emerald as long as my hand\", 'A thousandmen in cloth of gold, mounted upon richly caparisoned elephants,go before him, and as the procession moves onward the officerwho guides his elephant cries aloud, `Behold the mighty monarch,the powerful and valiant Sultan of the Indies, whose palaceis covered with a hundred thousand rubies, who possesses twentythousand diamond crowns', 'Behold a monarch greater than Solomonand Mihrage in all their glory', '\\'\"\"Then the one who stands behind the throne answers:  `This king,so great and powerful, must die, must die, must die', '\\'\"\"And the first takes up the chant again, `All praise to Himwho lives for evermore', '\\'\"\"Further, my lord, in Serendib no judge is needed, for to the kinghimself his people come for justice', '\"The Caliph was well satisfied with my report', '\"From the king\\'s letter,\" said he, \"I judged that he was a wise man', 'It seems that he is worthy of his people, and his people of him', '\"So saying he dismissed me with rich presents, and I returnedin peace to my own house', 'When Sindbad had done speaking his guests withdrew, Hindbad havingfirst received a hundred sequins, but all returned next day to hearthe story of the seventh voyage, Sindbad thus began', 'Seventh and Last VoyageAfter my sixth voyage I was quite determined that I would goto sea no more', 'I was now of an age to appreciate a quiet life,and I had run risks enough', 'I only wished to end my days in peace', 'One day, however, when I was entertaining a number of my friends,I was told that an officer of the Caliph wished to speak to me,and when he was admitted he bade me follow him into the presence ofHaroun al Raschid, which I accordingly did', 'After I had saluted him,the Caliph said:\"I have sent for you, Sindbad, because I need your services', 'I have chosen you to bear a letter and a gift to the King of Serendibin return for his message of friendship', '\"The Caliph\\'s commandment fell upon me like a thunderbolt', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" I answered, \"I am ready to do all thatyour Majesty commands, but I humbly pray you to remember that I amutterly disheartened by the unheard of sufferings I have undergone', 'Indeed, I have made a vow never again to leave Bagdad', '\"With this I gave him a long account of some of my strangest adventures,to which he listened patiently', '\"I admit,\" said he, \"that you have indeed had some extraordinaryexperiences, but I do not see why they should hinder you from doingas I wish', 'You have only to go straight to Serendib and givemy message, then you are free to come back and do as you will', 'But go you must; my honour and dignity demand it', '\"Seeing that there was no help for it, I declared myself willingto obey; and the Caliph, delighted at having got his own way,gave me a thousand sequins for the expenses of the voyage', 'I was soon ready to start, and taking the letter and the present Iembarked at Balsora, and sailed quickly and safely to Serendib', 'Here, when I had disclosed my errand, I was well received,and brought into the presence of the king, who greeted me with joy', '\"Welcome, Sindbad,\" he cried', '\"I have thought of you often,and rejoice to see you once more', '\"After thanking him for the honour that he did me, I displayed theCaliph\\'s gifts', 'First a bed with complete hangings all cloth of gold,which cost a thousand sequins, and another like to it of crimson stuff', 'Fifty robes of rich embroidery, a hundred of the finest whitelinen from Cairo, Suez, Cufa, and Alexandria', 'Then more bedsof different fashion, and an agate vase carved with the figureof a man aiming an arrow at a lion, and finally a costly table,which had once belonged to King Solomon', \"The King of Serendibreceived with satisfaction the assurance of the Caliph's friendlinesstoward him, and now my task being accomplished I was anxious to depart,but it was some time before the king would think of letting me go\", 'At last, however, he dismissed me with many presents, and I lostno time in going on board a ship, which sailed at once, and for fourdays all went well', 'On the fifth day we had the misfortune to fallin with pirates, who seized our vessel, killing all who resisted,and making prisoners of those who were prudent enough to submit at once,of whom I was one', 'When they had despoiled us of all we possessed,they forced us to put on vile raiment, and sailing to a distant islandthere sold us for slaves', 'I fell into the hands of a rich merchant,who took me home with him, and clothed and fed me well, and aftersome days sent for me and questioned me as to what I could do', 'I answered that I was a rich merchant who had bee captured by pirates,and therefore I knew no trade', '\"Tell me,\" said he, \"can you shoot with a bow', '\"I replied that this had been one of the pastimes of my youth,and that doubtless with practice my skill would come back to me', 'Upon this he provided me with a bow and arrows, and mounting me withhim upon his own elephant took the way to a vast forest which lay farfrom the town', 'When we had reached the wildest part of it we stopped,and my master said to me:  \"This forest swarms with elephants', 'Hide yourself in this great tree, and shoot at all that pass you', 'When you have succeeded in killing one come and tell me', '\"So saying he gave me a supply of food, and returned to the town,and I perched myself high up in the tree and kept watch', 'That nightI saw nothing, but just after sunrise the next morning a largeherd of elephants came crashing and trampling by', 'I lost no timein letting fly several arrows, and at last one of the great animalsfell to the ground dead, and the others retreated, leaving me freeto come down from my hiding place and run back to tell my masterof my success, for which I was praised and regaled with good things', 'Then we went back to the forest together and dug a mighty trenchin which we buried the elephant I had killed, in order that when itbecame a skeleton my master might return and secure its tusks', 'For two months I hunted thus, and no day passed without my securing,an elephant', 'Of course I did not always station myself in thesame tree, but sometimes in one place, sometimes in another', 'One morning as I watched the coming of the elephants I was surprisedto see that, instead of passing the tree I was in, as they usually did,they paused, and completely surrounded it, trumpeting horribly,and shaking the very ground with their heavy tread, and when Isaw that their eyes were fixed upon me I was terrified, and myarrows dropped from my trembling hand', 'I had indeed good reasonfor my terror when, an instant later, the largest of the animalswound his trunk round the stem of my tree, and with one mightyeffort tore it up by the roots, bringing me to the ground entangledin its branches', 'I thought now that my last hour was surely come;but the huge creature, picking me up gently enough, set me uponits back, where I clung more dead than alive, and followedby the whole herd turned and crashed off into the dense forest', 'It seemed to me a long time before I was once more set upon my feetby the elephant, and I stood as if in a dream watching the herd,which turned and trampled off in another direction, and were soonhidden in the dense underwood', 'Then, recovering myself, I lookedabout me, and found that I was standing upon the side of a great hill,strewn as far as I could see on either hand with bones and tusksof elephants', '\"This then must be the elephants\\' burying place,\"I said to myself, \"and they must have brought me here that I mightcease to persecute them, seeing that I want nothing but their tusks,and here lie more than I could carry away in a lifetime', '\"Whereupon I turned and made for the city as fast as I could go,not seeing a single elephant by the way, which convinced me thatthey had retired deeper into the forest to leave the way opento the Ivory Hill, and I did not know how sufficiently to admiretheir sagacity', \"After a day and a night I reached my master's house,and was received by him with joyful surprise\", '\"Ah', 'poor Sindbad,\" he cried, \"I was wondering what could have becomeof you', 'When I went to the forest I found the tree newly uprooted,and the arrows lying beside it, and I feared I should never seeyou again', 'Pray tell me how you escaped death', '\"I soon satisfied his curiosity, and the next day we went togetherto the Ivory Hill, and he was overjoyed to find that I had told himnothing but the truth', 'When we had loaded our elephant with asmany tusks as it could carry and were on our way back to the city,he said:\"My brother--since I can no longer treat as a slave one who hasenriched me thus--take your liberty and may Heaven prosper you', 'I will no longer conceal from you that these wild elephants havekilled numbers of our slaves every year', 'No matter what good advicewe gave them, they were caught sooner or later', 'You alone haveescaped the wiles of these animals, therefore you must be under thespecial protection of Heaven', 'Now through you the whole town willbe enriched without further loss of life, therefore you shall notonly receive your liberty, but I will also bestow a fortune upon you', '\"To which I replied, \"Master, I thank you, and wish you all prosperity', 'For myself I only ask liberty to return to my own country', '\"\"It is well,\" he answered, \"the monsoon will soon bring the ivoryships hither, then I will send you on your way with somewhat to payyour passage', '\"So I stayed with him till the time of the monsoon, and everyday we added to our store of ivory till all his ware-houseswere overflowing with it', 'By this time the other merchantsknew the secret, but there was enough and to spare for all', 'When the ships at last arrived my master himself chose the onein which I was to sail, and put on board for me a great store ofchoice provisions, also ivory in abundance, and all the costliestcuriosities of the country, for which I could not thank him enough,and so we parted', 'I left the ship at the first port we came to,not feeling at ease upon the sea after all that had happened to meby reason of it, and having disposed of my ivory for much gold,and bought many rare and costly presents, I loaded my pack animals,and joined a caravan of merchants', 'Our journey was long and tedious,but I bore it patiently, reflecting that at least I had not tofear tempests, nor pirates, nor serpents, nor any of the other perilsfrom which I had suffered before, and at length we reached Bagdad', 'My first care was to present myself before the Caliph, and give himan account of my embassy', 'He assured me that my long absence haddisquieted him much, but he had nevertheless hoped for the best', 'As to my adventure among the elephants he heard it with amazement,declaring that he could not have believed it had not my truthfulnessbeen well known to him', 'By his orders this story and the others I had told him were writtenby his scribes in letters of gold, and laid up among his treasures', 'I took my leave of him, well satisfied with the honours and rewards hebestowed upon me; and since that time I have rested from my labours,and given myself up wholly to my family and my friends', 'Thus Sindbad ended the story of his seventh and last voyage,and turning to Hindbad he added:\"Well, my friend, and what do you think now', 'Have you ever heardof anyone who has suffered more, or had more narrow escapes thanI have', 'Is it not just that I should now enjoy a life of easeand tranquillity', '\"Hindbad drew near, and kissing his hand respectfully, replied, \"Sir, youhave indeed known fearful perils; my troubles have been nothing comparedto yours', 'Moreover, the generous use you make of your wealth provesthat you deserve it May you live long and happily in the enjoyment in it', '\"Sindbad then gave him a hundred sequins, and hence-forward countedhim among his friends; also he caused him to give up his professionas a porter, and to eat daily at his table that he might all hislife remember Sindbad the Sailor', 'The Little HunchbackIn the kingdom of Kashgar, which is, as everybody knows,situated on the frontiers of Great Tartary, there lived long agoa tailor and his wife who loved each other very much', 'One day,when the tailor was hard at work, a little hunchback came and sat atthe entrance of the shop, and began to sing and play his tambourine', 'The tailor was amused with the antics of the fellow, and thoughthe would take him home to divert his wife', 'The hunchback havingagreed to his proposal, the tailor closed his shop and they setoff together', \"When they reached the house they found the table ready laid for supper,and in a very few minutes all three were sitting before a beautifulfish which the tailor's wife had cooked with her own hands\", 'But unluckily, the hunchback happened to swallow a large bone,and, in spite of all the tailor and his wife could do to help him,died of suffocation in an instant', 'Besides being very sorry forthe poor man, the tailor and his wife were very much frightened ontheir own account, for if the police came to hear of it the worthycouple ran the risk of being thrown into prison for wilful murder', 'In order to prevent this dreadful calamity they both set aboutinventing some plan which would throw suspicion on some one else,and at last they made up their minds that they could do no better thanselect a Jewish doctor who lived close by as the author of the crime', \"So the tailor picked up the hunchback by his head while his wifetook his feet and carried him to the doctor's house\", 'Then theyknocked at the door, which opened straight on to a steep staircase', 'A servant soon appeared, feeling her way down the dark staircaseand inquired what they wanted', '\"Tell your master,\" said the tailor, \"that we have brought a very sickman for him to cure; and,\" he added, holding out some money, \"give himthis in advance, so that he may not feel he is wasting his time', '\" The servant remounted the stairs to give the message to the doctor,and the moment she was out of sight the tailor and his wife carriedthe body swiftly after her, propped it up at the top of the staircase,and ran home as fast as their legs could carry them', 'Now the doctor was so delighted at the news of a patient (for hewas young, and had not many of them), that he was transportedwith joy', '\"Get a light,\" he called to the servant, \"and follow me as fast asyou can', '\" and rushing out of his room he ran towards the staircase', 'There he nearly fell over the body of the hunchback, and without knowingwhat it was gave it such a kick that it rolled right to the bottom,and very nearly dragged the doctor after it', '\"A light', 'a light', '\"he cried again, and when it was brought and he saw what he had donehe was almost beside himself with terror', '\"Holy Moses', '\" he exclaimed, \"why did I not wait for the light', 'I have killed the sick man whom they brought me; and if the sacredAss of Esdras does not come to my aid I am lost', 'It will not be longbefore I am led to jail as a murderer', '\"Agitated though he was, and with reason, the doctor did not forgetto shut the house door, lest some passers-by might chance to seewhat had happened', \"He then took up the corpse and carried itinto his wife's room, nearly driving her crazy with fright\", '\"It is all over with us', '\" she wailed, \"if we cannot find somemeans of getting the body out of the house', 'Once let the sunrise and we can hide it no longer', 'How were you driven to commitsuch a terrible crime', '\"\"Never mind that,\" returned the doctor, \"the thing is to find a wayout of it', '\"For a long while the doctor and his wife continued to turn overin their minds a way of escape, but could not find any that seemedgood enough', 'At last the doctor gave it up altogether and resignedhimself to bear the penalty of his misfortune', 'But his wife, who had twice his brains, suddenly exclaimed, \"I havethought of something', 'Let us carry the body on the roof of the houseand lower it down the chimney of our neighbour the Mussulman', '\" Now this Mussulman was employed by the Sultan, and furnishedhis table with oil and butter', 'Part of his house was occupiedby a great storeroom, where rats and mice held high revel', \"The doctor jumped at his wife's plan, and they took up the hunchback,and passing cords under his armpits they let him down into thepurveyor's bed-room so gently that he really seemed to be leaningagainst the wall\", 'When they felt he was touching the ground theydrew up the cords and left him', 'Scarcely had they got back to their own house when the purveyorentered his room', 'He had spent the evening at a wedding feast,and had a lantern in his hand', 'In the dim light it cast he wasastonished to see a man standing in his chimney, but being naturallycourageous he seized a stick and made straight for the supposed thief', '\"Ah', '\" he cried, \"so it is you, and not the rats and mice, who stealmy butter', \"I'll take care that you don't want to come back\", '\"So saying he struck him several hard blows', 'The corpse fell onthe floor, but the man only redoubled his blows, till at length itoccurred to him it was odd that the thief should lie so still and makeno resistance', 'Then, finding he was quite dead, a cold fear tookpossession of him', '\"Wretch that I am,\" said he, \"I have murdereda man', 'Ah, my revenge has gone too far', 'Without tho help of AllahI am undone', 'Cursed be the goods which have led me to my ruin', '\" And already he felt the rope round his neck', 'But when he had got over the first shock he began to think of someway out of the difficulty, and seizing the hunchback in his arms hecarried him out into the street, and leaning him against the wallof a shop he stole back to his own house, without once lookingbehind him', 'A few minutes before the sun rose, a rich Christian merchant,who supplied the palace with all sorts of necessaries, left his house,after a night of feasting, to go to the bath', 'Though he wasvery drunk, he was yet sober enough to know that the dawn was at hand,and that all good Mussulmen would shortly be going to prayer', 'So he hastened his steps lest he should meet some one on his wayto the mosque, who, seeing his condition, would send him to prisonas a drunkard', 'In his haste he jostled against the hunchback,who fell heavily upon him, and the merchant, thinking he was beingattacked by a thief, knocked him down with one blow of his fist', 'He then called loudly for help, beating the fallen man allthe while', 'The chief policeman of the quarter came running up, and founda Christian ill-treating a Mussulman', '\"What are you doing', '\"he asked indignantly', '\"He tried to rob me,\" replied the merchant, \"and very nearlychoked me', '\"\"Well, you have had your revenge,\" said the man, catching holdof his arm', '\"Come, be off with you', '\"As he spoke he held out his hand to the hunchback to help him up,but the hunchback never moved', '\"Oho', '\" he went on, looking closer,\"so this is the way a Christian has the impudence to treata Mussulman', '\" and seizing the merchant in a firm grasp he tookhim to the inspector of police, who threw him into prison tillthe judge should be out of bed and ready to attend to his case', 'All this brought the merchant to his senses, but the more he thoughtof it the less he could understand how the hunchback could have diedmerely from the blows he had received', 'The merchant was still pondering on this subject when he wassummoned before the chief of police and questioned about his crime,which he could not deny', \"As the hunchback was one of the Sultan'sprivate jesters, the chief of police resolved to defer sentenceof death until he had consulted his master\", 'He went to the palaceto demand an audience, and told his story to the Sultan, who only answered,\"There is no pardon for a Christian who kills a Mussulman', 'Do your duty', '\"So the chief of police ordered a gallows to be erected, and sentcriers to proclaim in every street in the city that a Christianwas to be hanged that day for having killed a Mussulman', 'When all was ready the merchant was brought from prison and ledto the foot of the gallows', 'The executioner knotted the cord firmlyround the unfortunate man\\'s neck and was just about to swing himinto the air, when the Sultan\\'s purveyor dashed through the crowd,and cried, panting, to the hangman,\"Stop, stop, don\\'t be in such a hurry', 'It was not he who didthe murder, it was I', '\"The chief of police, who was present to see that everything wasin order, put several questions to the purveyor, who told him thewhole story of the death of the hunchback, and how he had carriedthe body to the place where it had been found by the Christian merchant', '\"You are going,\" he said to the chief of police, \"to kill aninnocent man, for it is impossible that he should have murdereda creature who was dead already', 'It is bad enough for meto have slain a Mussulman without having it on my consciencethat a Christian who is guiltless should suffer through my fault', '\"Now the purveyor\\'s speech had been made in a loud voice, and washeard by all the crowd, and even if he had wished it, the chiefof police could not have escaped setting the merchant free', '\"Loose the cords from the Christian\\'s neck,\" he commanded,turning to the executioner, \"and hang this man in his place,seeing that by his own confession he is the murderer', '\"The hangman did as he was bid, and was tying the cord firmly,when he was stopped by the voice of the Jewish doctor beseechinghim to pause, for he had something very important to say', 'When he had fought his way through the crowd and reached the chiefof police,\"Worshipful sir,\" he began, \"this Mussulman whom you desireto hang is unworthy of death; I alone am guilty', 'Last nighta man and a woman who were strangers to me knocked at my door,bringing with them a patient for me to cure', 'The servant opened it,but having no light was hardly able to make out their faces,though she readily agreed to wake me and to hand me the fee formy services', 'While she was telling me her story they seem to havecarried the sick man to the top of the staircase and then lefthim there', 'I jumped up in a hurry without waiting for a lantern,and in the darkness I fell against something, which tumbled headlongdown the stairs and never stopped till it reached the bottom', 'When I examined the body I found it was quite dead, and the corpsewas that of a hunchback Mussulman', 'Terrified at what we had done,my wife and I took the body on the roof and let it down the chimneyof our neighbour the purveyor, whom you were just about to hang', 'The purveyor, finding him in his room, naturally thought he was a thief,and struck him such a blow that the man fell down and lay motionlesson the floor', 'Stooping to examine him, and finding him stone dead,the purveyor supposed that the man had died from the blow hehad received; but of course this was a mistake, as you will see frommy account, and I only am the murderer; and although I am innocentof any wish to commit a crime, I must suffer for it all the same,or else have the blood of two Musselmans on my conscience', 'Therefore send away this man, I pray you, and let me take his place,as it is I who am guilty', '\"On hearing the declaration of the Jewish doctor, the chief of policecommanded that he should be led to the gallows, and the Sultan\\'spurveyor go free', \"The cord was placed round the Jew's neck,and his feet had already ceased to touch the ground when the voiceof the tailor was heard beseeching the executioner to pause onemoment and to listen to what he had to say\", '\"Oh, my lord,\" he cried, turning to the chief of police,\"how nearly have you caused the death of three innocent people', 'But if you will only have the patience to listen to my tale,you shall know who is the real culprit', 'If some one has to suffer,it must be me', 'Yesterday, at dusk, I was working in my shop with alight heart when the little hunchback, who was more than half drunk,came and sat in the doorway', 'He sang me several songs, and thenI invited him to finish the evening at my house', 'He acceptedmy invitation, and we went away together', 'At supper I helped himto a slice of fish, but in eating it a bone stuck in his throat,and in spite of all we could do he died in a few minutes', 'We felt deeplysorry for his death, but fearing lest we should be held responsible,we carried the corpse to the house of the Jewish doctor', \"I knocked,and desired the servant to beg her master to come down as fastas possible and see a sick man whom we had brought for him to cure;and in order to hasten his movements I placed a piece of moneyin her hand as the doctor's fee\", 'Directly she had disappeared Idragged the body to the top of the stairs, and then hurried awaywith my wife back to our house', 'In descending the stairs the doctoraccidentally knocked over the corpse, and finding him dead believedthat he himself was the murderer', 'But now you know the truth sethim free, and let me die in his stead', '\"The chief of police and the crowd of spectators were lost in astonishmentat the strange events to which the death of the hunchback had given rise', '\"Loosen the Jewish doctor,\" said he to the hangman, \"and string upthe tailor instead, since he has made confession of his crime', 'Really, one cannot deny that this is a very singular story,and it deserves to be written in letters of gold', '\"The executioner speedily untied the knots which confined the doctor,and was passing the cord round the neck of the tailor, when theSultan of Kashgar, who had missed his jester, happened to makeinquiry of his officers as to what had become of him', '\"Sire,\" replied they, \"the hunchback having drunk more than wasgood for him, escaped from the palace and was seen wandering aboutthe town, where this morning he was found dead', 'A man was arrestedfor having caused his death, and held in custody till a gallowswas erected', 'At the moment that he was about to suffer punishment,first one man arrived, and then another, each accusing themselvesof the murder, and this went on for a long time, and at thepresent instant the chief of police is engaged in questioninga man who declares that he alone is the true assassin', '\"The Sultan of Kashgar no sooner heard these words than he orderedan usher to go to the chief of police and to bring all the personsconcerned in the hunchback\\'s death, together with the corpse,that he wished to see once again', 'The usher hastened on his errand,but was only just in time, for the tailor was positively swingingin the air, when his voice fell upon the silence of the crowd,commanding the hangman to cut down the body', \"The hangman,recognising the usher as one of the king's servants, cut downthe tailor, and the usher, seeing the man was safe, sought the chiefof police and gave him the Sultan's message\", 'Accordingly, the chiefof police at once set out for the palace, taking with him the tailor,the doctor, the purveyor, and the merchant, who bore the deadhunchback on their

circumstances that heordered his private historian to write down an exact account of whathad passed, so that in the years to come the miraculous escape of thefour men who had thought themselves murderers might never be forgotten', \"The Sultan asked everybody concerned in the hunchback's affairto tell him their stories\", 'Among others was a prating barber,whose tale of one of his brothers follows', \"Story of the Barber's Fifth BrotherAs long as our father lived Alnaschar was very idle\", 'Instead of workingfor his bread he was not ashamed to ask for it every evening, and tosupport himself next day on what he had received the night before', 'When our father died, worn out by age, he only left seven hundredsilver drachmas to be divided amongst us, which made one hundredfor each son', 'Alnaschar, who had never possessed so much moneyin his life, was quite puzzled to know what to do with it', 'After reflecting upon the matter for some time he decided to lay itout on glasses, bottles, and things of that sort, which he wouldbuy from a wholesale merchant', 'Having bought his stock he nextproceeded to look out for a small shop in a good position, where hesat down at the open door, his wares being piled up in an uncoveredbasket in front of him, waiting for a customer among the passers-by', 'In this attitude he remained seated, his eyes fixed on the basket,but his thoughts far away', 'Unknown to himself he began to talkout loud, and a tailor, whose shop was next door to his, heard quiteplainly what he was saying', '\"This basket,\" said Alnaschar to himself, \"has cost me a hundred drachmas--all that I possess in the world', 'Now in selling the contentspiece by piece I shall turn two hundred, and these hundreds Ishall again lay out in glass, which will produce four hundred', 'By this means I shall in course of time make four thousand drachmas,which will easily double themselves', 'When I have got ten thousand Iwill give up the glass trade and become a jeweller, and devote allmy time to trading in pearls, diamonds, and other precious stones', 'At last, having all the wealth that heart can desire, I will buya beautiful country house, with horses and slaves, and then I willlead a merry life and entertain my friends', 'At my feasts I willsend for musicians and dancers from the neighbouring town to amusemy guests', \"In spite of my riches I shall not, however, give up tradetill I have amassed a capital of a hundred thousand drachmas, when,having become a man of much consideration, I shall request the handof the grand-vizir's daughter, taking care to inform the worthyfather that I have heard favourable reports of her beauty and wit,and that I will pay down on our wedding day 3 thousand gold pieces\", 'Should the vizir refuse my proposal, which after all is hardly tobe expected, I will seize him by the beard and drag him to my house', '\"When I shall have married his daughter I will give her ten of the besteunuchs that can be found for her service', 'Then I shall put on my mostgorgeous robes, and mounted on a horse with a saddle of fine gold,and its trappings blazing with diamonds, followed by a trainof slaves, I shall present myself at the house of the grand-vizir,the people casting down their eyes and bowing low as I pass along', \"At the foot of the grand-vizir's staircase I shall dismount,and while my servants stand in a row to

a kick with his foot, which unluckily hitthe basket of glass', 'It fell into the street and was instantlybroken into a thousand pieces', '\"His neighbour the tailor, who had been listening to his visions,broke into a loud fit of laughter as he saw this sight', '\"Wretched man', '\" he cried, \"you ought to die of shame at behavingso to a young wife who has done nothing to you', 'You must bea brute for her tears and prayers not to touch your heart', 'If I were the grand-vizir I would order you a hundred blows froma bullock whip, and would have you led round the town accompaniedby a herald

his clothes and tore his hair,and lamented himself so loudly that the passers-by stopped to listen', 'It was a Friday, so these were more numerous than usual', 'Some pitied Alnaschar, others only laughed at him, but the vanitywhich had gone to his head had disappeared with his basket of glass,and he was loudly bewailing his folly when a lady, evidently a personof consideration, rode by on a mule', 'She stopped and inquiredwhat was the matter, and why the man wept', 'They told her that hewas a poor man who had laid out all his money on this basketof glass, which was now broken', 'On hearing the cause of these loudwails the lady turned to her attendant and said to him, \"Give himwhatever you have got with you', '\"  The man obeyed, and placed in mybrother\\'s hands a purse containing five hundred pieces of gold', 'Alnaschar almost died of joy on receiving it', 'He blessed the ladya thousand times, and, shutting up his shop where he had no longeranything to do, he returned home', 'He was still absorbed in contemplating his good fortune, when a knock cameto his door, and on opening it he found an old woman standing outside', '\"My son,\" she said, \"I have a favour to ask of you', 'It is the hourof prayer and I have not yet washed myself', 'Let me, I beg you,enter your house, and give me water', '\"My brother, although the old woman was a stranger to him, did nothesitate to do as she wished', 'He gave her a vessel of water and thenwent back to his place and his thoughts, and with his mind busy overhis last adventure, he put his gold into a long and narrow purse,which he could easily carry in his belt', 'During this time the oldwoman was busy over her prayers, and when she had finished shecame and prostrated herself twice before my brother, and thenrising called down endless blessings on his head', 'Observing hershabby clothes, my brother thought that her gratitude was in realitya hint that he should give her some money to buy some new ones,so he held out two pieces of gold', 'The old woman started backin surprise as if she had received an insult', '\"Good heavens', '\"she exclaimed, \"what is the meaning of this', 'Is it possible that youtake me, my lord, for one of those miserable creatures who forcetheir way into houses to beg for alms', 'Take back your money', 'I am thankful to say I do not need it, for I belong to a beautifullady who is very rich and gives me everything I want', '\"My brother was not clever enough to detect that the old woman hadmerely refused the two pieces of money he had offered her in orderto get more, but he inquired if she could procure him the pleasureof seeing this lady', '\"Willingly,\" she replied; \"and she will be charmed to marry you,and to make you the master of all her wealth', 'So pick up your moneyand follow me', '\"Delighted at the thought that he had found so easily both afortune and a beautiful wife, my brother asked no more questions,but concealing his purse, with the money the lady had given him,in the folds of his dress, he set out joyfully with his guide', 'They walked for some distance till the old woman stopped at alarge house, where she knocked', 'The door was opened by a youngGreek slave, and the old woman led my brother across a well-pavedcourt into a well-furnished hall', 'Here she left him to informher mistress of his presence, and as the day was hot he flunghimself on a pile of cushions and took off his heavy turban', 'In a few minutes there entered a lady, and my brother perceived atthe first glance that she was even more beautiful and more richlydressed than he had expected', 'He rose from his seat, but the ladysigned to him to sit down again and placed herself beside him', 'After the usual compliments had passed between them she said,\"We are not comfortable here, let us go into another room,\"and passing into a smaller chamber, apparently communicatingwith no other, she continued to talk to him for some time', 'Then rising hastily she left him, saying, \"Stay where you are,I will come back in a moment', '\"He waited as he was told, but instead of the lady there entered a hugeblack slave with a sword in his hand', 'Approaching my brother withan angry countenance he exclaimed, \"What business have you here', '\" His voice and manner were so terrific that Alnaschar had not strengthto reply, and allowed his gold to be taken from him, and evensabre cuts to be inflicted on him without making any resistance', 'As soon as he was let go, he sank on the ground powerless to move,though he still had possession of his senses', 'Thinking he was dead,the black ordered the Greek slave to bring him some salt, and betweenthem they rubbed it into his wounds, thus giving him acute agony,though he had the presence of mind to give no sign of life', 'They then left him, and their place was taken by the old woman,who dragged him to a trapdoor and threw him down into a vault filledwith the bodies of murdered men', 'At first the violence of his fall caused him to lose consciousness,but luckily the salt which had been rubbed into his wounds had byits smarting preserved his life, and little by little he regainedhis strength', 'At the end of two days he lifted the trapdoorduring the night and hid himself in the courtyard till daybreak,when he saw the old woman leave the house in search of more prey', 'Luckily she did not observe him, and when she was out of sight hestole from this nest of assassins and took refuge in my house', 'I dressed his wounds and tended him carefully, and when a monthhad passed he was as well as ever', 'His one thought was how tobe revenged on that wicked old hag, and for this purpose he hada purse made large enough to contain five hundred gold pieces,but filled it instead with bits of glass', 'This he tied roundhim with his sash, and, disguising himself as an old woman,he took a sabre, which he hid under his dress', 'One morning as he was hobbling through the streets he met hisold enemy prowling to see if she could find anyone to decoy', 'He went up to her and, imitating the voice of a woman, he said,\"Do you happen to have a pair of scales you could lend me', 'I have just come from Persia and have brought with me five hundredgold pieces, and I am anxious to see if they are the proper weight', '\"\"Good woman,\" replied the old hag, \"you could not have askedanyone better', 'My son is a money-changer, and if you will followme he will weigh them for you himself', 'Only we must be quick or hewill have gone to his shop', '\"  So saying she led the way to the samehouse as before, and the door was opened by the same Greek slave', 'Again my brother was left in the hall, and the pretended sonappeared under the form of the black slave', '\"Miserable crone,\"he said to my brother, \"get up and come with me,\" and turnedto lead the way to the place of murder', 'Alnaschar rose too,and drawing the sabre from under his dress dealt the black sucha blow on his neck that his head was severed from his body', 'My brother picked up the head with one hand, and seizing the bodywith the other dragged it to the vault, when he threw it in and sentthe head after it', 'The Greek slave, supposing that all had passedas usual, shortly arrived with the basin of salt, but when shebeheld Alnaschar with the sabre in his hand she let the basin falland turned to fly', 'My brother, however, was too quick for her,and in another instant her head was rolling from her shoulders', 'The noise brought the old woman running to see what was the matter,and he seized her before she had time to escape', '\"Wretch', '\" he cried,\"do you know me', '\"\"Who are you, my lord', '\" she replied trembling all over', '\"I havenever seen you before', '\"\"I am he whose house you entered to offer your hypocritical prayers', \"Don't you remember now\", '\"She flung herself on her knees to implore mercy, but he cut herin four pieces', 'There remained only the lady, who was quite ignorant of all thatwas taking place around her', 'He sought her through the house,and when at last he found her, she nearly fainted with terror atthe sight of him', 'She begged hard for life, which he was generousenough to give her, but he bade her to tell him how she had got intopartnership with the abominable creatures he had just put to death', '\"I was once,\" replied she, \"the wife of an honest merchant, and thatold woman, whose wickedness I did not know, used occasionally tovisit me', '\"Madam,\" she said to me one day, \"we have a grand weddingat our house to-day', 'If you would do us the honour to be present,I am sure you would enjoy yourself', '\"  I allowed myself to be persuaded,put on my richest dress, and took a purse with a hundred pieces of gold', 'Once inside the doors I was kept by force by that dreadful black,and it is now three years that I have been here, to my great grief', '\"\"That horrible black must have amassed great wealth,\" remarked my brother', '\"Such wealth,\" returned she, \"that if you succeed in carrying itall away it will make you rich for ever', 'Come and let us seehow much there is', '\"She led Alnaschar into a chamber filled with coffers packed with gold,which he gazed at with an admiration he was powerless to conceal', '\"Go,\"she said, \"and bring men to carry them away', '\"My brother did not wait to be told twice, and hurried out intothe streets, where he soon collected ten men', 'They all came backto the house, but what was his surprise to find the door open,and the room with the chests of gold quite empty', 'The lady had beencleverer than himself, and had made the best use of her time', 'However,he tried to console himself by removing all the beautiful furniture,which more than made up for the five hundred gold pieces he had lost', 'Unluckily, on leaving the house, he forgot to lock the door,and the neighbours, finding the place empty, informed the police,who next morning arrested Alnaschar as a thief', 'My brother tried to bribethem to let him off, but far from listening to him they tied his hands,and forced him to walk between them to the presence of the judge', 'When they had explained to the official the cause of complaint,he asked Alnaschar where he had obtained all the furniture that hehad taken to his house the day before', '\"Sir,\" replied Alnaschar, \"I am ready to tell you the whole story,but give, I pray you, your word, that I shall run no risk of punishment', '\"\"That I promise,\" said the judge', 'So my brother began at thebeginning and related all his adventures, and how he had avengedhimself on those who had betrayed him', 'As to the furniture,he entreated the judge at least to allow him to keep part to makeup for the five hundred pieces of gold which had been stolen from him', 'The judge, however, would say nothing about this, and lost no timein sending men to fetch away all that Alnaschar had taken fromthe house', 'When everything had been moved and placed under his roofhe ordered my brother to leave the town and never more to enter iton peril of his life, fearing that if he returned he might seekjustice from the Caliph', 'Alnaschar obeyed, and was on his wayto a neighbouring city when he fell in with a band of robbers,who stripped him of his clothes and left him naked by the roadside', 'Hearing of his plight, I hurried after him to console him forhis misfortunes, and to dress him in my best robe', 'I then broughthim back disguised, under cover of night, to my house, where Ihave since given him all the care I bestow on my other brothers', \"The Story of the Barber's Sixth BrotherThere now remains for me to relate to you the story of my sixth brother,whose name was Schacabac\", 'Like the rest of us, he inheriteda hundred silver drachmas from our father, which he thoughtwas a large fortune, but through ill-luck, he soon lost it all,and was driven to beg', 'As he had a smooth tongue and good manners,he really did very well in his new profession, and he devotedhimself specially to making friends with the servants in big houses,so as to gain access to their masters', 'One day he was passing a splendid mansion, with a crowd of servantslounging in the courtyard', 'He thought that from the appearanceof the house it might yield him a rich harvest, so he enteredand inquired to whom it belonged', '\"My good man, where do you come from', '\" replied the servant', '\"Can\\'t yousee for yourself that it can belong to nobody but a Barmecide', '\"for the Barmecides were famed for their liberality and generosity', 'My brother, hearing this, asked the porters, of whom there were several,if they would give him alms', 'They did not refuse, but told himpolitely to go in, and speak to the master himself', 'My brother thanked them for their courtesy and entered the building,which was so large that it took him some time to reach the apartmentsof the Barmecide', 'At last, in a room richly decorated with paintings,he saw an old man with a long white beard, sitting on a sofa,who received him with such kindness that my brother was emboldenedto make his petition', '\"My lord,\" he said, \"you behold in me a poor man who only livesby the help of persons as rich and as generous as you', '\"Before he could proceed further, he was stopped by the astonishmentshown by the Barmecide', '\"Is it possible,\" he cried, \"that while Iam in Bagdad, a man like you should be starving', 'That is a stateof things that must at once be put an end to', 'Never shall it be saidthat I have abandoned you, and I am sure that you, on your part,will never abandon me', '\"\"My lord,\" answered my brother, \"I swear that I have not brokenmy fast this whole day', '\"\"What, you are dying of hunger', '\" exclaimed the Barmecide', '\"Here, slave; bring water, that we may wash our hands before meat', '\" No slave appeared, but my brother remarked that the Barmecide didnot fail to rub his hands as if the water had been poured over them', 'Then he said to my brother, \"Why don\\'t you wash your hands too', '\"and Schacabac, supposing that it was a joke on the part of theBarmecide (though he could see none himself), drew near, and imitatedhis motion', 'When the Barmecide had done rubbing his hands, he raised his voice,and cried, \"Set food before us at once, we are very hungry', '\" No food was brought, but the Barmecide pretended to help himselffrom a dish, and carry a morsel to his mouth, saying as he did so,\"Eat, my friend, eat, I entreat', 'Help yourself as freely as ifyou were at home', 'For a starving man, you seem to have a verysmall appetite', '\"\"Excuse me, my lord,\" replied Schacabac, imitating his gesturesas before, \"I really am not losing time, and I do full justiceto the repast', '\"\"How do you like this bread', '\" asked the Barmecide', '\"I find itparticularly good myself', '\"\"Oh, my lord,\" answered my brother, who beheld neither meat nor bread,\"never have I tasted anything so delicious', '\"\"Eat as much as you want,\" said the Barmecide', '\"I boughtthe woman who makes it for five hundred pieces of gold,so that I might never be without it', '\"After ordering a variety of dishes (which never came) to be placed onthe table, and discussing the merits of each one, the Barmecide declaredthat having dined so well, they would now proceed to take their wine', 'To this my brother at first objected, declaring that it was forbidden;but on the Barmecide insisting that it was out of the questionthat he should drink by himself, he consented to take a little', 'The Barmecide, however, pretended to fill their glasses so often,that my brother feigned that the wine had gone into his head,and struck the Barmecide such a blow on the head, that he fell tothe ground', 'Indeed, he raised his hand to strike him a second time,when the Barmecide cried out that he was mad, upon which my brothercontrolled himself, and apologised and protested that it wasall the fault of the wine he had drunk', 'At this the Barmecide,instead of being angry, began to laugh, and embraced him heartily', '\"I have long been seeking,\" he exclaimed, \"a man of your description,and henceforth my house shall be yours', 'You have had the goodgrace to fall in with my humour, and to pretend to eat and to drinkwhen nothing was there', 'Now you shall be rewarded by a reallygood supper', '\"Then he clapped his hands, and all the dishes were brought thatthey had tasted in imagination before and during the repast,slaves sang and played on various instruments', 'All the whileSchacabac was treated by the Barmecide as a familiar friend,and dressed in a garment out of his own wardrobe', 'Twenty years passed by, and my brother was still living withthe Barmecide, looking after his house, and managing his affairs', 'At the end of that time his generous benefactor died without heirs,so all his possessions went to the prince', 'They even despoiledmy brother of those that rightly belonged to him, and he,now as poor as he had ever been in his life, decided to castin his lot with a caravan of pilgrims who were on their wayto Mecca', 'Unluckily, the caravan was attacked and pillaged bythe Bedouins, and the pilgrims were taken prisoners', 'My brotherbecame the slave of a man who beat him daily, hoping to drive himto offer a ransom, although, as Schacabac pointed out, it wasquite useless trouble, as his relations were as poor as himself', 'At length the Bedouin grew tired of tormenting, and sent him ona camel to the top of a high barren mountain, where he left himto take his chance', 'A passing caravan, on its way to Bagdad,told me where he was to be found, and I hurried to his rescue,and brought him in a deplorable condition back to the town', '\"This,\"--continued the barber,--\"is the tale I relatedto the Caliph, who, when I had finished, burst into fits of laughter', '\"\"Well were you called `the Silent,\\'\" said he; \"no name was everbetter deserved', 'But for reasons of my own, which it is not necessaryto mention, I desire you to leave the town, and never to come back', '\"\"I had of course no choice but to obey, and travelled about for severalyears until I heard of the death of the Caliph, when I hastilyreturned to Bagdad, only to find that all my brothers were dead', 'It was at this time that I rendered to the young cripple the importantservice of which you have heard, and for which, as you know,he showed such profound ingratitude, that he preferred ratherto leave Bagdad than to run the risk of seeing me', 'I sought himlong from place to place, but it was only to-day, when I expectedit least, that I came across him, as much irritated with me as ever\"--So saying the tailor went on to relate the story of the lame manand the barber, which has already been told', '\"When the barber,\" he continued, \"had finished his tale, we cameto the conclusion that the young man had been right, when hehad accused him of being a great chatter-box', 'However, we wishedto keep him with us, and share our feast, and we remained at tabletill the hour of afternoon prayer', 'Then the company broke up,and I went back to work in my shop', '\"\"It was during this interval that the little hunchback, half drunkalready, presented himself before me, singing and playing on his drum', 'I took him home, to amuse my wife, and she invited him to supper', 'While eating some fish, a bone got into his throat, and in spiteof all we could do, he died shortly', 'It was all so sudden that welost our heads, and in order to divert suspicion from ourselves,we carried the body to the house of a Jewish physician', 'He placedit in the chamber of the purveyor, and the purveyor propped it up inthe street, where it was thought to have been killed by the merchant', '\"\"This, Sire, is the story which I was obliged to tell to satisfyyour highness', 'It is now for you to say if we deserve mercyor punishment; life or death', '\"The Sultan of Kashgar listened with an air of pleasure which filledthe tailor and his friends with hope', '\"I must confess,\" he exclaimed,\"that I am much more interested in the stories of the barber andhis brothers, and of the lame man, than in that of my own jester', 'But before I allow you all four to return to your own homes, and havethe corpse of the hunchback properly buried, I should like to seethis barber who has earned your pardon', 'And as he is in this town,let an usher go with you at once in search of him', '\"The usher and the tailor soon returned, bringing with them an old manwho must have been at least ninety years of age', '\"O Silent One,\"said the Sultan, \"I am told that you know many strange stories', 'Will you tell some of them to me', '\"\"Never mind my stories for the present,\" replied the barber,\"but will your Highness graciously be pleased to explain why this Jew,this Christian, and this Mussulman, as well as this dead body,are all here', '\"\"What business is that of yours', '\" asked the Sultan with a smile;but seeing that the barber had some reasons for his question,he commanded that the tale of the hunch-back should be told him', '\"It is certainly most surprising,\" cried he, when he had heard it all,\"but I should like to examine the body', '\"  He then knelt down, and tookthe head on his knees, looking at it attentively', 'Suddenly he burstinto such loud laughter that he fell right backwards, and when hehad recovered himself enough to speak, he turned to the Sultan', '\"The man is no more dead than I am,\" he said; \"watch me', '\"  As hespoke he drew a small case of medicines from his pocket and rubbedthe neck of the hunchback with some ointment made of balsam', \"Next heopened the dead man's mouth, and by the help of a pair of pincersdrew the bone from his throat\", 'At this the hunch-back sneezed,stretched himself and opened his eyes', 'The Sultan and all those who saw this operation did not know whichto admire most, the constitution of the hunchback who had apparentlybeen dead for a whole night and most of one day, or the skill ofthe barber, whom everyone now began to look upon as a great man', \"His Highness desired that the history of the hunchback should bewritten down, and placed in the archives beside that of the barber,so that they might be associated in people's minds to the end of time\", 'And he did not stop there; for in order to wipe out the memory ofwhat they had undergone, he commanded that the tailor, the doctor,the purveyor and the merchant, should each be clothed in his presencewith a robe from his own wardrobe before they returned home', 'As for the barber, he bestowed on him a large pension, and kept himnear his own person', \"The Adventures of Prince Camaralzaman

towns, and the whole formsan important kingdom', 'It was governed in former days by a kingnamed Schahzaman, who, with good right, considered himself one ofthe most peaceful, prosperous, and fortunate monarchs on the earth', 'In fact, he had but one grievance, which was that none of his fourwives had given him an heir', 'This distressed him so greatly that one day he confided his griefto the grand-vizir, who, being a wise counsellor, said:  \"Such mattersare indeed beyond human aid', 'Allah alone can grant your desire,and I should advise you, sire, to send large gifts to those holy menwho spend their lives in prayer, and to beg for their intercessions', 'Who knows whether their petitions may not be answered', '\"The king took his vizir\\'s advice, and the result of so many prayers foran heir to the throne was that a son was born to him the following year', 'Schahzaman sent noble gifts as thank offerings to all the mosquesand religious houses, and great rejoicings were celebrated in honourof the birth of the little prince, who was so beautiful that hewas named Camaralzaman, or \"Moon of the Century', '\"Prince Camaralzaman was brought up with extreme care by an excellentgovernor and all the cleverest teachers, and he did such credit to themthat when he was grown up, a more charming and accomplished young manwas not to be found', 'Whilst he was still a youth

state all his objections', '\"Sire,\" he replied, \"the prince is still very young for the caresof state', 'Your Majesty fears his growing idle and careless,and doubtless you are right', 'But how would it be if he were firstto marry', 'This would attach him to his home, and your Majestymight give him a share in your counsels, so that he might graduallylearn how to wear a crown, which you can give up to him wheneveryou find him capable of wearing it', '\"The vizir\\'s advice once more struck the king as being good,and he sent for his son, who lost no time in obeying the summons,and standing respectfully with downcast eyes before the king askedfor his commands', '\"I have sent for you,\" said the king, \"to say that I wish you to marry', 'What do you think about it', '\"The prince was so much overcome by these words that he remainedsilent for some time', 'At length he said:  \"Sire, I beg youto pardon me if I am unable to reply as you might wish', 'I certainly did not expect such a proposal as I am still so young,and I confess that the idea of marrying is very distasteful to me', 'Possibly I may not always be in this mind, but I certainly feelthat it will require some time to induce me to take the stepwhich your Majesty desires', '\"This answer greatly distressed the king, who was sincerely grievedby his objection to marriage', 'However he would not have recourseto extreme measures, so he said:  \"I do not wish to force you;I will give you time to reflect, but remember that such a stepis necessary, for a prince such as you who will some day be calledto rule over a great kingdom', '\"From this time Prince Camaralzaman was admitted to the royal council,and the king showed him every mark of favour', 'At the end of a year the king took his son aside, and said: \"Well, my son, have you changed your mind on the subject of marriage,or do you still refuse to obey my wish', '\"The prince was less surprised but no less firm than on theformer occasion, and begged his father not to press the subject,adding that it was quite useless to urge him any longer', 'This answer much distressed the king, who again confided his troubleto his vizir', '\"I have followed your advice,\" he said; \"but Camaralzaman declinesto marry, and is more obstinate than ever', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the vizir, \"much is gained by patience, and yourMajesty might regret any violence', 'Why not wait another year and theninform the Prince in the midst of the assembled council that the goodof the state demands his marriage', 'He cannot possibly refuse againbefore so distinguished an assemblage, and in our immediate presence', '\"The Sultan ardently desired to see his son married at once, but heyielded to the vizir\\'s arguments and decided to wait', 'He then visitedthe prince\\'s mother, and after telling her of his disappointmentand of the further respite he had given his son, he added: \"I know that Camaralzaman confides more in you than he does in me', 'Pray speak very seriously to him on this subject, and make him realisethat he will most seriously displease me if he remains obstinate,and that he will certainly regret the measures I shall be obligedto take to enforce my will', '\"So the first time the Sultana Fatima saw her son she told him shehad heard of his refusal to marry, adding how distressed she feltthat he should have vexed his father so much', 'She asked what reasonshe could have for his objections to obey', '\"Madam,\" replied the prince, \"I make no doubt that there are asmany good, virtuous, sweet, and amiable women as there are othersvery much the reverse', 'Would that all were like you', 'But what revoltsme is the idea of marrying a woman without knowing anything at allabout her', 'My father will ask the hand of the daughter of someneighbouring sovereign, who will give his consent to our union', 'Be she fair or frightful, clever or stupid, good or bad, I mustmarry her, and am left no choice in the matter', 'How am I to knowthat she will not be proud, passionate, contemptuous, and recklesslyextravagant, or that her disposition will in any way suit mine', '\"\"But, my son,\" urged Fatima, \"you surely do not wish to be the lastof a race which has reigned so long and so gloriously over this kingdom', '\"\"Madam,\" said the prince, \"I have no wish to survive the king,my father, but should I do so I will try to reign in such a manneras may be considered worthy of my predecessors', '\"These and similar conversations proved to the Sultan how useless itwas to argue with his son, and the year elapsed without bringingany change in the prince\\'s ideas', 'At length a day came when the Sultan summoned him before the council,and there informed him that not only his own wishes but the goodof the empire demanded his marriage, and desired him to give hisanswer before the assembled ministers', 'At this Camaralzaman grew so angry and spoke with so much heatthat the king, naturally irritated at being opposed by his sonin full council, ordered the prince to be arrested and locked upin an old tower, where he had nothing but a very little furniture,a few books, and a single slave to wait on him', 'Camaralzaman, pleased to be free to enjoy his books, showed himselfvery indifferent to his sentence', 'When night came he washed himself, performed his devotions,and, having read some pages of the Koran, lay down on a couch,without putting out the light near him, and was soon asleep', 'Now there was a deep well in the tower in which PrinceCamaralzaman was imprisoned, and this well was a favouriteresort of the fairy Maimoune, daughter of Damriat, chief of alegion of genii', 'Towards midnight Maimoune floated lightlyup from the well, intending, according to her usual habit,to roam about the upper world as curiosity or accident might prompt', \"The light in the prince's room surprised her, and without disturbingthe slave, who slept across the threshold, she entered the room,and approaching the bed was still more astonished to find it occupied\", 'The prince lay with his face half hidden by the coverlet', 'Maimoune lifted it a little and beheld the most beautiful youthshe had ever seen', '\"What a marvel of beauty he must be when his eyes are open', '\"she thought', '\"What can he have done to deserve to be treatedlike this', '\"She could not weary gazing at Camaralzaman, but at length,having softly kissed his brow and each cheek, she replacedthe coverlet and resumed her flight through the air', 'As she entered the middle region she heard the sound of great wingscoming towards her, and shortly met one of the race of bad genii', 'This genie, whose name was Danhasch, recognised Maimoune with terror,for he knew the supremacy which her goodness gave her over him', 'He would gladly have avoided her altogether, but they were so nearthat he must either be prepared to fight or yield to her, so he at onceaddressed her in a conciliatory tone:\"Good Maimoune, swear to me by Allah to do me no harm, and on myside I will promise not to injure you', '\"\"Accursed genie', '\" replied Maimoune, \"what harm can you do me', 'But I will grant your power and give the promise you ask', 'And nowtell me what you have seen and done to-night', '\"\"Fair lady,\" said Danhasch, \"you meet me at the right moment to hearsomething really interesting', 'I must tell you that I come from thefurthest end of China, which is one of the largest and most powerfulkingdoms in the world', 'The present king has one only daughter, who isso perfectly lovely that neither you, nor I, nor any other creaturecould find adequate terms in which to describe her marvellous charms', 'You must therefore picture to yourself the most perfect features,joined to a brilliant and delicate complexion, and an enchantingexpression, and even then imagination will fall short of the reality', '\"\"The king, her father, has carefully shielded this treasure fromthe vulgar gaze, and has taken every precaution to keep her fromthe sight of everyone except the happy mortal he may choose to beher husband', 'But in order to give her variety in her confinement hehas built her seven palaces such as have never been seen before', 'The first palace is entirely composed of rock crystal, the secondof bronze, the third of fine steel, the fourth of another and moreprecious species of bronze, the fifth of touchstone, the sixthof silver, and the seventh of solid gold', 'They are all mostsumptuously furnished, whilst the gardens surrounding them arelaid out with exquisite taste', 'In fact, neither trouble nor costhas been spared to make this retreat agreeable to the princess', 'The report of her wonderful beauty has spread far and wide, and manypowerful kings have sent embassies to ask her hand in marriage', 'The king has always received these embassies graciously, but saysthat he will never oblige the princess to marry against her will,and as she regularly declines each fresh proposal, the envoys havehad to leave as disappointed in the result of their missions as theywere gratified by their magnificent receptions', '\"Sire,\" said the princess to her father, \"you wish me to marry,and I know you desire to please me, for which I am very grateful', 'But, indeed, I have no inclination to change my state,for where could I find so happy a life amidst so many beautifuland delightful surroundings', 'I feel that I could never be as happywith any husband as I am here, and I beg you not to press one on me', '\"\"At last an embassy came from a king so rich and powerful that theKing of China felt constrained to urge this suit on his daughter', 'He told her how important such an alliance would be, and pressedher to consent', 'In fact, he pressed her so persistingly that theprincess at length lost her temper and quite forgot the respect dueto her father', \"`Sire,' cried she angrily, `do not speak furtherof this or any other marriage or I will plunge this dagger in mybreast and so escape from all these importunities\", '\\'\"\"The king of China was extremely indignant with his daughter and replied: `You have lost your senses and you must be treated accordingly', '\\'\" So he had her shut in one set of rooms in one of her palaces,and only allowed her ten old women, of whom her nurse was the head,to wait on her and keep her company', \"He next sent letters to allthe kings who had sued for the princess's hand, begging they wouldthink of her no longer, as she was quite insane, and he desiredhis various envoys to make it known that anyone who could cure hershould have her to wife\", '\"Fair Maimoune,\" continued Danhasch, \"this is the present stateof affairs', 'I never pass a day without going to gaze on thisincomparable beauty, and I am sure that if you would onlyaccompany me you would think the sight well worth the trouble,and own that you never saw such loveliness before', '\"The fairy only answered with a peal of laughter, and when at lengthshe had control of her voice she cried, \"Oh, come, you are makinggame of me', 'I thought you had something really interesting to tellme instead of raving about some unknown damsel', 'What would you sayif you could see the prince I have just been looking at and whosebeauty is really transcendent', 'That is something worth talking about,you would certainly quite lose your head', '\"\"Charming Maimoune,\" asked Danhasch, \"may I inquire who and whatis the prince of whom you speak', '\"\"Know,\" replied Maimoune, \"that he is in much the same case asyour princess', \"The king, his father, wanted to force him to marry,and on the prince's refusal to obey he has been imprisoned in an oldtower where I have just seen him\", '\"\"I don\\'t like to contradict a lady,\" said Danhasch, \"but you mustreally permit me to doubt any mortal being as beautiful as my princess', '\"\"Hold your tongue,\" cried Maimoune', '\"I repeat that is impossible', '\"\"Well, I don\\'t wish to seem obstinate,\" replied Danhasch, \"the bestplan to test the truth of what I say will be for you to let metake you to see the princess for yourself', '\"\"There is no need for that,\" retorted Maimoune; \"we can satisfyourselves in another way', 'Bring your princess here and layher down beside my prince', 'We can then compare them at leisure,and decide which is in the right', '\"Danhasch readily consented, and after having the tower where the princewas confined pointed out to him, and making a wager with Maimoune as tothe result of the comparison, he flew off to China to fetch the princess', 'In an incredibly short time Danhasch returned, bearing thesleeping princess', \"Maimoune led him to the prince's room,and the rival beauty was placed beside him\", 'When the prince and princess lay thus side by side, an animateddispute as to their respective charms arose between the fairyand the genius', 'Danhasch began by saying:\"Now you see that my princess is more beautiful than your prince', 'Can you doubt any longer', '\"\"Doubt', 'Of course I do', '\" exclaimed Maimoune', '\"Why, you mustbe blind not to see how much my prince excels your princess', 'I do not deny that your princess is very handsome, but only lookand you must own that I am in the right', '\"\"There is no need for me to look longer,\" said Danhasch, \"my firstimpression will remain the same; but of course, charming Maimoune,I am ready to yield to you if you insist on it', '\"\"By no means,\" replied Maimoune', '\"I have no idea of being underany obligation to an accursed genius like you', 'I refer the matterto an umpire, and shall expect you to submit to his verdict', '\"Danhasch readily agreed, and on Maimoune striking the floor with herfoot it opened, and a hideous, hump-backed, lame, squinting genius,with six horns on his head, hands like claws, emerged', 'As soon as hebeheld Maimoune he threw himself at her feet and asked her commands', '\"Rise, Caschcasch,\" said she', '\"I summoned you to judge between meand Danhasch', 'Glance at that couch, and say without any partialitywhether you think the youth or the maiden lying there the more beautiful', '\"Caschcasch looked at the prince and princess with every tokenof surprise and admiration', 'At length, having gazed long withoutbeing able to come to a decision, he said\"Madam, I must confess that I should deceive you were I to declareone to be handsomer than the other', 'There seems to me only oneway in which to decide the matter, and that is to wake one afterthe other and judge which of them expresses the greater admirationfor the other', '\"This advice pleased Maimoune and Danhasch, and the fairy at oncetransformed herself into the shape of a gnat and settling onCamaralzaman\\'s throat stung him so sharply that he awoke', 'As he didso his eyes fell on the Princess of China', 'Surprised at findinga lady so near him, he raised himself on one arm to look at her', 'The youth and beauty of the princess at once awoke a feeling to which hisheart had as yet been a stranger, and he could not restrain his delight', '\"What loveliness', 'What charms', 'Oh, my heart, my soul', '\" he exclaimed,as he kissed her forehead, her eyes and mouth in a way which wouldcertainly have roused her had not the genie\\'s enchantments kepther asleep', '\"How, fair lady', '\" he cried, \"you do not wake at the signs ofCamaralzaman\\'s love', 'Be you who you may, he is not unworthy of you', '\"It then suddenly occurred to him, that perhaps this was the bridehis father had destined for him, and that the King had probablyhad her placed in this room in order to see how far Camaralzaman\\'saversion to marriage would withstand her charms', '\"At all events,\" he thought, \"I will take this ring as a remembranceof her', '\"So saying he drew off a fine ring which the princess wore onher finger, and replaced it by one of his own', 'After which helay down again and was soon fast asleep', 'Then Danhasch, in his turn, took the form of a gnat and bitthe princess on her lip', 'She started up, and was not a little amazed at seeing a young manbeside her', 'From surprise she soon passed to admiration, and thento delight on perceiving how handsome and fascinating he was', '\"Why,\" cried she, \"was it you my father wished me to marry', 'How unlucky that I did not know sooner', 'I should not have madehim so angry', 'But wake up', 'wake up', 'for I know I shall love youwith all my heart', '\"So saying she shook Camaralzaman so violently that nothingbut the spells of Maimoune could have prevented his waking', '\"Oh', '\" cried the princess', '\"Why are you so drowsy', '\"  So saying shetook his hand and noticed her own ring on his finger, which made herwonder still more', 'But as he still remained in a profound slumbershe pressed a kiss on his cheek and soon fell fast asleep too', 'Then Maimoune turning to the genie said:  \"Well, are you satisfiedthat my prince surpasses your princess', 'Another time pray believeme when I assert anything', '\"Then turning to Caschcasch:  \"My thanks to you, and now do youand Danhasch bear the princess back to her own home', '\"The two genii hastened to obey, and Maimoune returned to her well', 'On waking next morning the first thing Prince Camaralzaman didwas to look round for the lovely lady he had seen at night,and the next to question the slave who waited on him about her', 'But the slave persisted so strongly that he knew nothing of any lady,and still less of how she got into the tower, that the prince lostall patience, and after giving him a good beating tied a rope round himand ducked him in the well till the unfortunate man cried out that hewould tell everything', 'Then the prince drew him up all dripping wet,but the slave begged leave to change his clothes first, and as soonas the prince consented hurried off just as he was to the palace', 'Here he found the king talking to the grand-vizir of all the anxietyhis son had caused him', 'The slave was admitted at once and cried:\"Alas, Sire', 'I bring sad news to your Majesty', 'There can be nodoubt that the prince has completely lost his senses', 'He declaresthat he saw a lady sleeping on his couch last night, and the stateyou see me in proves how violent contradiction makes him', '\" He then gave a minute account of all the prince had said and done', 'The king, much moved, begged the vizir to examine into thisnew misfortune, and the latter at once went to the tower, where hefound the prince quietly reading a book', 'After the first exchangeof greetings the vizir said:\"I feel really very angry with your slave for alarming his Majestyby the news he brought him', '\"\"What news', '\" asked the prince', '\"Ah', '\" replied the vizir, \"something absurd, I feel sure, seeing howI find you', '\"\"Most likely,\" said the prince; \"but now that you are here I amglad of the opportunity to ask you where is the lady who sleptin this room last night', '\"The grand-vizir felt beside himself at this question', '\"Prince', '\" he exclaimed, \"how would it be possible for any man,much less a woman, to enter this room at night without walking overyour slave on the threshold', 'Pray consider the matter, and youwill realise that you have been deeply impressed by some dream', '\"But the prince angrily insisted on knowing who and where the lady was,and was not to be persuaded by all the vizir\\'s protestations to thecontrary that the plot had not been one of his making', 'At last,losing patience, he seized the vizir by the beard and loaded himwith blows', '\"Stop, Prince,\" cried the unhappy vizir, \"stay and hear what Ihave to say', '\"The prince, whose arm was getting tired, paused', '\"I confess, Prince,\" said the vizir, \"that there is some foundationfor what you say', \"But you know well that a minister has to carryout his master's orders\", 'Allow me to go and to take to the kingany message you may choose to send', '\"\"Very well,\" said the prince; \"then go and tell him that I consentto marry the lady whom he sent or brought here last night', 'Be quick and bring me back his answer', '\"The vizir bowed to the ground and hastened to leave the room and tower', '\"Well,\" asked the king as soon as he appeared, \"and how did youfind my son', '\"\"Alas, sire,\" was the reply, \"the slave\\'s report is only too true', '\"He then gave an exact account of his interview with Camaralzamanand of the prince\\'s fury when told that it was not possible for anylady to have entered his room, and of the treatment he himselfhad received', 'The king, much distressed, determined to clearup the matter himself, and, ordering the vizir to follow him,set out to visit his son', 'The prince received his father with profound respect, and the king,making him sit beside him, asked him several questions, to whichCamaralzaman replied with much good sense', 'At last the king said: \"My son, pray tell me about the lady who, it is said, was in your roomlast night', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the prince, \"pray do not increase my distressin this matter, but rather make me happy by giving her to mein marriage', 'However much I may have objected to matrimony formerly,the sight of this lovely girl has overcome all my prejudices,and I will gratefully receive her from your hands', '\"The king was almost speechless on hearing his son, but after a timeassured him most solemnly that he knew nothing whatever aboutthe lady in question, and had not connived at her appearance', 'He then desired the prince to relate the whole story to him', 'Camaralzaman did so at great length, showed the ring, and imploredhis father to help to find the bride he so ardently desired', '\"After all you tell me,\" remarked the king, \"I can no longer doubtyour word; but how and whence the lady came, or why she shouldhave stayed so short a time I cannot imagine', 'The whole affairis indeed mysterious', 'Come, my dear son, let us wait togetherfor happier days', '\"So saying the king took Camaralzaman by the hand and led him backto the palace, where the prince took to his bed and gave himself upto despair, and the king shutting himself up with his son entirelyneglected the affairs of state', 'The prime minister, who was the only person admitted, felt it hisduty at last to tell the king how much the court and all the peoplecomplained of his seclusion, and how bad it was for the nation', \"He urged the sultan to remove with the prince to a lovely littleisland close by, whence he could easily attend public audiences,and where the charming scenery and fine air would do the invalid somuch good as to enable him to bear his father's occasional absence\", 'The king approved the plan, and as soon as the castle on the islandcould be prepared for their reception he and the prince arrived there,Schahzaman never leaving his son except for the prescribed publicaudiences twice a week', 'Whilst all this was happening in the capital of Schahzaman the twogenii had carefully borne the Princess of China back to her ownpalace and replaced her in bed', 'On waking next morning she firstturned from one side to another and then, finding herself alone,called loudly for her women', '\"Tell me,\" she cried, \"where is the young man I love so dearly,and who slept near me last night', '\"\"Princess,\" exclaimed the nurse, \"we cannot tell what you alludeto without more explanation', '\"\"Why,\" continued the princess, \"the most charming and beautiful youngman lay sleeping beside me last night', 'I did my utmost to wake him,but in vain', '\"\"Your Royal Highness wishes to make game of us,\" said the nurse', '\"Is it your pleasure to rise', '\"\"I am quite in earnest,\" persisted the princess, \"and I want to knowwhere he is', '\"\"But, Princess,\" expostulated the nurse, \"we left you quite alonelast night, and we have seen no one enter your room since then', '\"At this the princess lost all patience, and taking the nurse by herhair she boxed her ears soundly, crying out:  \"You shall tell me,you old witch, or I\\'ll kill you', '\"The nurse had no little trouble in escaping, and hurried off tothe queen, to whom she related the whole story with tears in her eyes', '\"You see, madam,\" she concluded, \"that the princess must be outof her mind', 'If only you will come and see her, you will be ableto judge for yourself', '\"The queen hurried to her daughter\\'s apartments, and after tenderlyembracing her, asked her why she had treated her nurse so badly', '\"Madam,\" said the princess, \"I perceive that your Majesty wishesto make game of me, but I can assure you that I will never marryanyone except the charming young man whom I saw last night', 'You must know where he is, so pray send for him', '\"The queen was much surprised by these words, but when shedeclared that she knew nothing whatever of the matter theprincess lost all respect, and answered that if she were notallowed to marry as she wished she should kill herself, andit was in vain that the queen tried to pacify her and bring her to reason', 'The king himself came to hear the rights of the matter, but theprincess only persisted in her story, and as a proof showed the ringon her finger', 'The king hardly knew what to make of it all, but endedby thinking that his daughter was more crazy than ever, and withoutfurther argument he had her placed in still closer confinement,with only her nurse to wait on her and a powerful guard to keep the door', 'Then he assembled his council, and having told them the sad stateof things, added:  \"If any of you can succeed in curing the princess,I will give her to him in marriage, and he shall be my heir', '\"An elderly emir present, fired with the desire to possess a youngand lovely wife and to rule over a great kingdom, offered to trythe magic arts with which he was acquainted', '\"You are welcome to try,\" said the king, \"but I make one condition,which is, that should you fail you will lose your life', '\"The emir accepted the condition, and the king led him to the princess,who, veiling her face, remarked, \"I am surprised, sire, that youshould bring an unknown man into my presence', '\"\"You need not be shocked,\" said the king; \"this is one of my emirswho asks your hand in marriage', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the princess, \"this is not the one you gave mebefore and whose ring I wear', 'Permit me to say that I can acceptno other', '\"The emir, who had expected to hear the princess talk nonsense,finding how calm and reasonable she was, assured the king that hecould not venture to undertake a cure, but placed his head at hisMajesty\\'s disposal, on which the justly irritated monarch promptlyhad it cut off', 'This was the first of many suitors for the princess whose inabilityto cure her cost them their lives', \"Now it happened that after things had been going on in this way forsome time the nurse's son Marzavan returned from his travels\", 'He hadbeen in many countries and learnt many things, including astrology', 'Needless to say that one of the first things his mother told himwas the sad condition of the princess, his foster-sister', \"Marzavanasked if she could not manage to let him see the princess withoutthe king's knowledge\", \"After some consideration his mother consented, and even persuadedthe eunuch on guard to make no objection to Marzavan's enteringthe royal apartment\", 'The princess was delighted to see her foster-brother again,and after some conversation she confided to him all her historyand the cause of her imprisonment', 'Marzavan listened with downcast eyes and the utmost attention', 'When she had finished speaking he said,\"If what you tell me, Princess, is indeed the case, I do not despairof finding comfort for you', 'Take patience yet a little longer', 'I will set out at once to explore other countries, and when you hearof my return be sure that he for whom you sigh is not far off', '\" So saying, he took his leave and started next morning on his travels', 'Marzavan journeyed from city to city and from one island and provinceto another, and wherever he went he heard people talk of the strangestory of the Princess Badoura, as the Princess of China was named', 'After four months he reached a large populous seaport town named Torf,and here he heard no more of the Princess Badoura but a great dealof Prince Camaralzaman, who was reported ill, and whose storysounded very similar to that of the Princess Badoura', \"Marzavan was rejoiced, and set out at once for PrinceCamaralzaman's residence\", 'The ship on which he embarked hada prosperous voyage till she got within sight of the capitalof King Schahzaman, but when just about to enter the harbour shesuddenly struck on a rock, and foundered within sight of thepalace where the prince was living with his father and the grand-vizir', 'Marzavan, who swam well, threw himself into the sea and managedto land close to the palace, where he was kindly received,and after having a change of clothing given him was brought beforethe grand-vizir', 'The vizir was at once attracted by the young man\\'ssuperior air and intelligent conversation, and perceiving that hehad gained much experience in the course of his travels, he said,\"Ah, how I wish you had learnt some secret which might enable youto cure a malady which has plunged this court into afflictionfor some time past', '\"Marzavan replied that if he knew what the illness was he mightpossibly be able to suggest a remedy, on which the vizir relatedto him the whole history of Prince Camaralzaman', \"On hearing this Marzavan rejoiced inwardly, for he felt sure that hehad at last discovered the object of the Princess Badoura's infatuation\", 'However, he said nothing, but begged to be allowed to see the prince', 'On entering the royal apartment the first thing which struckhim was the prince himself, who lay stretched out on his bedwith his eyes closed', 'The king sat near him, but, without payingany regard to his presence, Marzavan exclaimed, \"Heavens', 'what astriking likeness', '\"  And, indeed, there was a good deal of resemblancebetween the features of Camaralzaman and those of the Princess of China', 'These words caused the prince to open his eyes with languid curiosity,and Marzavan seized this moment to pay him his compliments,contriving at the same time to express the condition of the Princessof China in terms unintelligible, indeed, to the Sultan and his vizir,but which left the prince in no doubt that his visitor could givehim some welcome information', 'The prince begged his father to allow him the favour of a privateinterview with Marzavan, and the king was only too pleased to findhis son taking an interest in anyone or anything', 'As soon as theywere left alone Marzavan told the prince the story of the PrincessBadoura and her sufferings, adding, \"I am convinced that you alonecan cure her; but before starting on so long a journey you mustbe well and strong, so do your best to recover as quickly as may be', '\"These words produced a great effect on the prince, who was so muchcheered by the hopes held out that he declared he felt ableto get up and be dressed', \"The king was overjoyed at the resultof Marzavan s interview, and ordered public rejoicings in honourof the prince's recovery\", 'Before long the prince was quite restored to his original stateof health, and as soon as he felt himself really strong he tookMarzavan aside and said:\"Now is the time to perform your promise', 'I am so impatient to seemy beloved princess once more that I am sure I shall fall illagain if we do not start soon', \"The one obstacle is my father'stender care of me, for, as you may have noticed, he cannot bearme out of his sight\", '\"\"Prince,\" replied Marzavan, \"I have already thought over the matter,and this is what seems to me the best plan', 'You have not beenout of doors since my arrival', \"Ask the king's permission to gowith me for two or three days' hunting, and when he has givenleave order two good horses to be held ready for each of us\", 'Leave all the rest to me', '\"Next day the prince seized a favourable opportunity for makinghis request, and the king gladly granted it on condition thatonly one night should be spent out for fear of too great fatigueafter such a long illness', 'Next morning Prince Camaralzaman and Marzavan were off betimes,attended by two grooms leading the two extra horses', 'They hunteda little by the way, but took care to get as far from the townsas possible', 'At night-fall they reached an inn, where they suppedand slept till midnight', 'Then Marzavan awoke and roused the princewithout disturbing anyone else', 'He begged the prince to give himthe coat he had been wearing and to put on another which they hadbrought with them', \"They mounted their second horses, and Marzavanled one of the grooms' horses by the bridle\", 'By daybreak our travellers found themselves where four cross roadsmet in the middle of the forest', \"Here Marzavan begged the princeto wait for him, and leading the groom's horse into a dense partof the wood he cut its throat, dipped the prince's coat in its blood,and having rejoined the prince threw the coat on the ground wherethe roads parted\", \"In answer to Camaralzaman's inquiries as to the reason for this,Marzavan replied that the only chance they had of continuing their journeywas to divert attention by creating the idea of the prince's death\", '\"Your father will doubtless be plunged in the deepest grief,\"he went on, \"but his joy at your return will be all the greater', '\"The prince and his companion now continued their journey by landand sea, and as they had brought plenty of money to defray theirexpenses they met with no needless delays', 'At length they reachedthe capital of China, where they spent three days in a suitablelodging to recover from their fatigues', \"During this time Marzavan had an astrologer's dressprepared for the prince\", \"They then went to the baths,after which the prince put on the astrologer's robe and wasconducted within sight of the king's palace by Marzavan,who left him there and went to consult his mother, the princess's nurse\", 'Meantime the prince, according to Marzavan\\'s instructions,advanced close to the palace gates and there proclaimed aloud:\"I am an astrologer and I come to restore health tothe Princess Badoura, daughter of the high and mightyKing of China, on the conditions laid down by HisMajesty of marrying her should I succeed, or of losing my life if I fail', '\"It was some little time since anyone had presented himself to runthe terrible risk involved in attempting to cure the princess,and a crowd soon gathered round the prince', 'On perceiving his youth,good looks, and distinguished bearing, everyone felt pity for him', '\"What are you thinking of, sir,\" exclaimed some; \"why expose yourselfto certain death', 'Are not the heads you see exposed on the townwall sufficient warning', \"For mercy's sake give up this mad ideaand retire whilst you can\", '\"But the prince remained firm, and only repeated his cry withgreater assurance, to the horror of the crowd', '\"He is resolved to die', '\" they cried; \"may heaven have pity on him', '\"Camaralzaman now called out for the third time, and at lastthe grand-vizir himself came out and fetched him in', 'The prime minister led the prince to the king, who was much struckby the noble air of this new adventurer, and felt such pity forthe fate so evidently in store for him, that he tried to persuadethe young man to renounce his project', \"But Camaralzaman politely yet firmly persisted in his intentions,and at length the king desired the eunuch who had the guard of theprincess's apartments to conduct the astrologer to her presence\", 'The eunuch led the way through long passages, and Camaralzamanfollowed rapidly, in haste to reach the object of his desires', 'At last they came to a large hall which was the ante-room to theprincess\\'s chamber, and here Camaralzaman said to the eunuch:\"Now you shall choose', 'Shall I cure the princess in her own presence,or shall I do it from here without seeing her', '\"The eunuch, who had expressed many contemptuous doubts as they camealong of the newcomer\\'s powers, was much surprised and said:\"If you really can cure, it is immaterial when you do it', 'Your fame will be equally great', '\"\"Very well,\" replied the prince:  \"then, impatient though I amto see the princess, I will effect the cure where I stand,the better to convince you of my power', '\"  He accordingly drewout his writing case and wrote as follows--\"Adorable princess', 'The enamoured Camaralzaman has never forgotten the moment when,contemplating your sleeping beauty, he gave you his heart', 'As he was at that time deprived of the happiness of conversingwith you, he ventured to give you his ring as a token of his love,and to take yours in exchange, which he now encloses in this letter', 'Should you deign to return it to him he will be the happiestof mortals, if not he will cheerfully resign himself to death,seeing he does so for love of you', 'He awaits your reply in yourante-room', '\"Having finished this note the prince carefully enclosed the ring in itwithout letting the eunuch see it, and gave him the letter, saying:\"Take this to your mistress, my friend, and if on reading itand seeing its contents she is not instantly cured, you may callme an impudent impostor', '\"The eunuch at once passed into the princess\\'s room, and handingher the letter said:\"Madam, a new astrologer has arrived, who declares that you will becured as soon as you have read this letter and seen what it contains', '\"The princess took the note and opened it with languid indifference', 'But no sooner did she see her ring than, barely glancing at the writing,she rose hastily and with one bound reached the doorway and pushedback the hangings', \"Here she and the prince recognised each other,and in a moment they were locked in each other's arms, where theytenderly embraced, wondering how they came to meet at last afterso long a separation\", 'The nurse, who had hastened after her charge,drew them back to the inner room, where the princess restored her ringto Camaralzaman', '\"Take it back,\" she said, \"I could not keep it without returningyours to you, and I am resolved to wear that as long as I live', '\"Meantime the eunuch had hastened back to the king', '\"Sire,\" he cried,\"all the former doctors and astrologers were mere quacks', 'This man has cured the princess without even seeing her', '\" He then told all to the king, who, overjoyed, hastened to hisdaughter\\'s apartments, where, after embracing her, he placedher hand in that of the prince, saying:\"Happy stranger, I keep my promise, and give you my daughter to wife,be you who you may', 'But, if I am not much mistaken, your conditionis above what you appear to be', '\"The prince thanked the king in the warmest and most respectful terms,and added:  \"As regards my person, your Majesty has rightly guessedthat I am not an astrologer', 'It is but a disguise which I assumedin order to merit your illustrious alliance', 'I am myself a prince,my name is Camaralzaman, and my father is Schahzaman, King of theIsles of the Children of Khaledan', '\"  He then told his whole history,including the extraordinary manner of his first seeing and lovingthe Princess Badoura', 'When he had finished the king exclaimed:  \"So remarkable a story mustnot be lost to posterity', 'It shall be inscribed in the archivesof my kingdom and published everywhere abroad', '\"The wedding took place next day amidst great pomp and rejoicings', 'Marzavan was not forgotten, but was given a lucrative post at court,with a promise of further advancement', \"The prince and princess were now entirely happy, and months slippedby unconsciously in the enjoyment of each other's society\", 'One night, however, Prince Camaralzaman dreamt that he saw hisfather lying at the point of death, and saying:  \"Alas', 'my son whomI loved so tenderly, has deserted me and is now causing my death', '\"The prince woke with such a groan as to startle the princess,who asked what was the matter', '\"Ah', '\" cried the prince, \"at this very moment my father is perhapsno more', '\" and he told his dream', 'The princess said but little at the time, but next morning she wentto the king, and kissing his hand said:\"I have a favour to ask of your Majesty, and I beg you to believethat it is in no way prompted by my husband', 'It is that you willallow us both to visit my father-in-law King Schahzaman', '\"Sorry though the king felt at the idea of parting with his daughter,he felt her request to be so reasonable that he could not refuse it,and made but one condition, which was that she should only spendone year at the court of King Schahzaman, suggesting that in futurethe young couple should visit their respective parents alternately', 'The princess brought this good news to her husband, who thankedher tenderly for this fresh proof of her affection', 'All preparations for the journey were now pressed forwards, and whenall was ready the king accompanied the travellers for some days,after which he took an affectionate leave of his daughter, and chargingthe prince to take every care of her, returned to his capital', 'The prince and princess journeyed on, and at the end of a monthreached a huge meadow interspersed with clumps of big trees which casta most pleasant shade', 'As the heat was great, Camaralzaman thought itwell to encamp in this cool spot', 'Accordingly the tents were pitched,and the princess entering hers whilst the prince was giving hisfurther orders, removed her girdle, which she placed beside her,and desiring her women to leave her, lay down and was soon asleep', 'When the camp was all in order the prince entered the tent and,seeing the princess asleep, he sat down near her without speaking', 'His eyes fell on the girdle which, he took up, and whilst inspectingthe precious stones set in it he noticed a little pouch sewnto the girdle and fastened by a loop', 'He touched it and feltsomething hard within', 'Curious as to what this might be, he openedthe pouch and found a cornelian engraved with various figuresand strange characters', '\"This cornelian must be something very precious,\" thought he,\"or my wife would not wear it on her person with so much care', '\"In truth it was a talisman which the Queen of China had givenher daughter, telling her it would ensure her happiness as longas she carried it about her', 'The better to examine the stone the prince stepped to the opendoorway of the tent', 'As he stood there holding it in the openpalm of his hand, a bird suddenly swooped down, picked the stoneup in its beak and flew away with it', \"Imagine the prince's dismay at losing a thing by which his wifeevidently set such store\", 'The bird having secured its prey flew off some yards andalighted on the ground, holding the talisman it its beak', 'Prince Camaralzaman advanced, hoping the bird would drop it, but assoon as he approached the thief fluttered on a little further still', 'He continued his pursuit till the bird suddenly swallowed the stoneand took a longer flight than before', 'The prince then hoped to killit with a stone, but the more hotly he pursued the further flew the bird', 'In this fashion he was led on by hill and dale through the entire day,and when night came the tiresome creature roosted on the topof a very high tree where it could rest in safety', 'The prince in despair at all his useless trouble began to thinkwhether he had better return to the camp', '\"But,\" thought he,\"how shall I find my way back', 'Must I go up hill or down', 'I should certainly lose my way in the dark, even if my strengthheld out', '\"  Overwhelmed by hunger, thirst, fatigue and sleep,he ended by spending the night at the foot of the tree', 'Next morning Camaralzaman woke up before the bird left its perch,and no sooner did it take flight than he followed it againwith as little success as the previous day, only stopping to eatsome herbs and fruit he found by the way', 'In this fashion hespent ten days, following the bird all day and spending the nightat the foot of a tree, whilst it roosted on the topmost bough', 'On the eleventh day the bird and the prince reached a large town,and as soon as they were close to its walls the bird took a suddenand higher flight and was shortly completely out of sight,whilst Camaralzaman felt in despair at having to give up all hopesof ever recovering the talisman of the Princess Badoura', 'Much cast down, he entered the town, which was built near the seaand had a fine harbour', 'He walked about the streets for a long time,not knowing where to go, but at length as he walked near the seashorehe found a garden door open and walked in', 'The gardener, a good old man, who was at work, happened to look up,and, seeing a stranger, whom he recognised by his dress as a Mussulman,he told him to come in at once and to shut the door', 'Camaralzaman did as he was bid, and inquired why this precautionwas taken', '\"Because,\" said the gardener, \"I see that you are a stranger anda Mussulman, and this town is almost entirely inhabited by idolaters,who hate and persecute all of our faith', 'It seems almost a miraclethat has led you to this house, and I am indeed glad that youhave found a place of safety', '\"Camaralzaman warmly thanked the kind old man for offering him shelter,and was about to say more, but the gardener interrupted him with:\"Leave compliments alone', 'You are weary and must be hungry', 'Come in, eat, and rest', '\"  So saying he led the prince into his cottage,and after satisfying his hunger begged to learn the cause ofhis arrival', \"Camaralzaman told him all without disguise, and ended by inquiringthe shortest way to his father's capital\", '\"For,\" added he,\"if I tried to rejoin the princess, how should I find her aftereleven days\\' separation', 'Perhaps, indeed, she may be no longer alive', '\" At this terrible thought he burst into tears', \"The gardener informed Camaralzaman that they were quite a year's landjourney to any Mahomedan country, but that there was a much shorterroute by sea to the Ebony Island, from whence the Isles of the Childrenof Khaledan could be easily reached, and that a ship sailed oncea year for the Ebony Island by which he might get so far as his very home\", '\"If only you had arrived a few days sooner,\" he said, \"you mighthave embarked at once', 'As it is you must now wait till next year,but if you care to stay with me I offer you my house, such as it is,with all my heart', '\"Prince Camaralzaman thought himself lucky to find some place of refuge,and gladly accepted the gardener\\'s offer', 'He spent his days working inthe garden, and his nights thinking of and sighing for his beloved wife', 'Let us now see what had become during this time of the Princess Badoura', 'On first waking she was much surprised not to find the princenear her', 'She called her women and asked if they knew where he was,and whilst they were telling her that they had seen him enterthe tent, but had not noticed his leaving it, she took up her beltand perceived that the little pouch was open and the talisman gone', 'She at once concluded that her husband had taken it and would shortlybring it back', 'She waited for him till evening rather impatiently,and wondering what could have kept him from her so long', 'When nightcame without him she felt in despair and abused the talismanand its maker roundly', 'In spite of her grief and anxiety however,she did not lose her presence of mind, but decided on a courageous,though very unusual step', \"Only the princess and her women knew of Camaralzaman's disappearance,for the rest of the party were sleeping or resting in their tents\", \"Fearing some treason should the truth be known, she ordered herwomen not to say a word which would give rise to any suspicion,and proceeded to change her dress for one of her husband's, to whom,as has been already said, she bore a strong likeness\", 'In this disguise she looked so like the prince that when she gaveorders next morning to break up the camp and continue the journey noone suspected the change', 'She made one of her women enter her litter,whilst she herself mounted on horseback and the march began', 'After a protracted journey by land and sea the princess, still underthe name and disguise of Prince Camaralzaman, arrived at the capitalof the Ebony Island whose king was named Armanos', 'No sooner did the king hear that the ship which was just in porthad on board the son of his old friend and ally than he hurriedto meet the supposed prince, and had him and his retinue broughtto the palace, where they were lodged and entertained sumptuously', 'After three days, finding that his guest, to whom he had takena great fancy, talked of continuing his journey, King Armanos saidto him:\"Prince, I am now an old man, and unfortunately 1 have no sonto whom to leave my kingdom', 'It has pleased Heaven to give meonly one daughter, who possesses such great beauty and charmthat I could only give her to a prince as highly born and asaccomplished as yourself', 'Instead, therefore, of returning to yourown country, take my daughter and my crown and stay with us', 'I shall feel that I have a worthy successor, and shall cheerfullyretire from the fatigues of government', '\"The king\\'s offer was naturally rather embarrassing to the PrincessBadoura', 'She felt that it was equally impossible to confess that shehad deceived him, or to refuse the marriage on which he had set his heart;a refusal which might turn all his kindness to hatred and persecution', 'All things considered, she decided to accept, and after a few momentssilence said with a blush, which the king attributed to modesty:\"Sire, I feel so great an obligation for the good opinionyour Majesty has expressed for my person and of the honouryou do me, that, though I am quite unworthy of it,I dare not refuse', 'But, sire, I can only accept suchan alliance if you give me your promise to assist me with your counsels', '\"The marriage being thus arranged, the ceremony was fixed for thefollowing day, and the princess employed the intervening time ininforming the officers of her suite of what had happened, assuring themthat the Princess Badoura had given her full consent to the marriage', 'She also told her women, and bade them keep her secret well', 'King Armanos, delighted with the success of his plans, lost notime in assembling his court and council, to whom he presentedhis successor, and placing his future son-in-law on the thronemade everyone do homage and take oaths of allegiance to the new king', \"At night the whole town was filled with rejoicings, and with much pompthe Princess Haiatelnefous (this was the name of the king's daughter)was conducted to the palace of the Princess Badoura\", \"Now Badoura had thought much of the difficulties of her firstinterview with King Armanos' daughter, and she felt the only thingto do was at once to take her into her confidence\", 'Accordingly, as soon as they were alone she took Haiatelnefousby the hand and said:\"Princess, I have a secret to tell you, and must throw myselfon your mercy', 'I am not Prince Camaralzaman, but a princesslike yourself and his wife, and I beg you to listen to my story,then I am sure you will forgive my imposture, in considerationof my sufferings', '\"She then related her whole history, and at its close Haiatelnefousembraced her warmly, and assured her of her entire sympathyand affection', \"The two princesses now planned out their future action, and agreedto combine to keep up the deception and to let Badoura continueto play a man's part until such time as there might be newsof the real Camaralzaman\", 'Whilst these things were passing in the Ebony Island PrinceCamaralzaman continued to find shelter in the gardeners cottagein the town of the idolaters', 'Early one morning the gardener said to the prince:\"To-day is a public holiday, and the people of the town not onlydo not work themselves but forbid others to do so', 'You had bettertherefore take a good rest whilst I go to see some friends, and asthe time is near for the arrival of the ship of which I told you Iwill make inquiries about it, and try to bespeak a passage for you', '\" He then put on his best clothes and went out, leaving the prince,who strolled into the garden and was soon lost in thoughts of hisdear wife and their sad separation', 'As he walked up and down he was suddenly disturbed in his reverieby the noise two large birds were making in a tree', 'Camaralzaman stood still and looked up, and saw that the birds werefighting so savagely with beaks and claws that before long one fell deadto the ground, whilst the conqueror spread his wings and flew away', 'Almost immediately two other larger birds, who had been watching the duel,flew up and alighted, one at the head and the other at the feet ofthe dead bird', 'They stood there some time sadly shaking their heads,and then dug up a grave with their claws in which they buried him', 'As soon as they had filled in the grave the two flew off, and erelong returned, bringing with them the murderer, whom they held,one by a wing and the other by a leg, with their beaks, screaming andstruggling with rage and terror', \"But they held tight, and havingbrought him to his victim's grave, they proceeded to kill him,after which they tore open his body, scattered the inside and oncemore flew away\", 'The prince, who had watched the whole scene with much interest,now drew near the spot where it happened, and glancing at the deadbird he noticed something red lying near which had evidently fallenout of its inside', \"He picked it up, and what was his surprise when herecognised the Princess Badoura's talisman which had been the causeof many misfortunes\", 'It would be impossible to describe his joy;he kissed the talisman repeatedly, wrapped it up, and carefullytied it round his arm', 'For the first time since his separationfrom the princess he had a good night, and next morning he was upat day-break and went cheerfully to ask what work he should do', 'The gardener told him to cut down an old fruit tree which had quitedied away, and Camaralzaman took an axe and fell to vigorously', 'As he was hacking at one of the roots the axe struck on something hard', 'On pushing away the earth he discovered a large slab of bronze,under which was disclosed a staircase with ten steps', 'He went down them and found himself in a roomy kind of cavein which stood fifty large bronze jars, each with a cover on it', 'The prince uncovered one after another, and found them all filledwith gold dust', \"Delighted with his discovery he left the cave,replaced the slab, and having finished cutting down the tree waitedfor the gardener's return\", 'The gardener had heard the night before that the ship about which hewas inquiring would start ere long, but the exact date not being yetknown he had been told to return next day for further information', 'He had gone therefore to inquire, and came back with good newsbeaming in his face', '\"My son,\" said he, \"rejoice and hold yourself ready to startin three days\" time', 'The ship is to set sail, and I have arrangedall about your passage with the captain\"You could not bring me better news,\" replied Camaralzaman,\"and in return I have something pleasant to tell you', 'Follow meand see the good fortune which has befallen you', '\"He then led the gardener to the cave, and having shown him thetreasure stored up there, said how happy it made him that Heavenshould in this way reward his kind host\\'s many virtues and compensatehim for the privations of many years', '\"What do you mean', '\" asked the gardener', '\"Do you imagine that I shouldappropriate this treasure', 'It is yours, and I have no right whateverto it', 'For the last eighty years I have dug up the ground here withoutdiscovering anything', 'It is clear that these riches are intendedfor you, and they are much more needed by a prince like yourselfthan by an old man like me, who am near my end and require nothing', 'This treasure comes just at the right time, when you are aboutto return to your own country, where you will make good use of it', '\"But the prince would not hear of this suggestion, and finallyafter much discussion they agreed to divide the gold', 'When thiswas done the gardener said:\"My son, the great thing now is to arrange how you can best carryoff this treasure as secretly as possible for fear of losing it', 'There are no olives in the Ebony Island, and those imported fromhere fetch a high price', 'As you know, I have a good stock of theolives which grew in this garden', 'Now you must take fifty jars,fill each half full of gold dust and fill them up with the olives', 'We will then have them taken on board ship when you embark', '\"The prince took this advice, and spent the rest of the day fillingthe fifty jars, and fearing lest the precious talisman might slipfrom his arm and be lost again, he took the precaution of puttingit in one of the jars, on which he made a mark so as to be ableto recognise it', 'When night came the jars were all ready,and the prince and his host went to bed', 'Whether in consequence of his great age, or of the fatigues and excitementof the previous day, I do not know, but the gardener passed a verybad night', 'He was worse next day, and by the morning of the third day wasdangerously ill', \"At daybreak the ship's captain and some of his sailorsknocked at the garden door and asked for the passenger who was to embark\", '\"I am he,\" said Camaralzaman, who had opened the door', '\"The gardener who took my passage is ill and cannot see you,but please come in and take these jars of olives and my bag,and I will follow as soon as I have taken leave of him', '\"The sailors did as he asked, and the captain before leaving chargedCamaralzaman to lose no time, as the wind was fair, and he wishedto set sail at once', 'As soon as they were gone the prince returned to the cottageto bid farewell to his old friend, and to thank him once morefor all his kindness', 'But the old man was at his last gasp,and had barely murmured his confession of faith when he expired', 'Camaralzaman was obliged to stay and pay him the last offices,so having dug a grave in the garden he wrapped the kind old man upand buried him', 'He then locked the door, gave up the key to the ownerof the garden, and hurried to the quay only to hear that the shiphad sailed long ago, after waiting three hours for him', 'It may well be believed that the prince felt in despair at thisfresh misfortune, which obliged him to spend another year in a strangeand distasteful country', \"Moreover, he had once more lost the PrincessBadoura's talisman, which he feared he might never see again\", 'There was nothing left for him but to hire the garden as the old manhad done, and to live on in the cottage', 'As he could not well cultivatethe garden by himself, he engaged a lad to help him, and to securethe rest of the treasure he put the remaining gold dust into fifty morejars, filling them up with olives so as to have them ready for transport', 'Whilst the prince was settling down to this second year of toiland privation, the ship made a rapid voyage and arrived safelyat the Ebony Island', 'As the palace of the new king, or rather of the Princess Badoura,overlooked the harbour, she saw the ship entering it and asked whatvessel it was coming in so gaily decked with flags, and was toldthat it was a ship from the Island of the Idolaters which yearlybrought rich merchandise', 'The princess, ever on the look out for any chance of news of herbeloved husband, went down to the harbour attended by some officersof the court, and arrived just as the captain was landing', 'She sent forhim and asked many questions as to his country, voyage, what passengershe had, and what his vessel was laden with', 'The captain answered allher questions, and said that his passengers consisted entirely of traderswho brought rich stuffs from various countries, fine muslins, preciousstones, musk, amber, spices, drugs, olives, and many other things', 'As soon as he mentioned olives, the princess, who was very partialto them, exclaimed:\"I will take all you have on board', 'Have them unloaded and wewill make our bargain at once, and tell the other merchants to letme see all their best wares before showing them to other people', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the captain, \"I have on board fifty very largepots of olives', 'They belong to a merchant who was left behind,as in spite of waiting for him he delayed so long that I was obligedto set sail without him', '\"\"Never mind,\" said the princess, \"unload them all the same, and wewill arrange the price', '\"The captain accordingly sent his boat off to the ship and it soonreturned laden with the fifty pots of olives', 'The princess askedwhat they might be worth', '\"Sire,\" replied the captain, \"the merchant is very poor', 'Your Majestywill not overpay him if you give him a thousand pieces of silver', '\"\"In order to satisfy him and as he is so poor,\" said the princess,\"I will order a thousand pieces of gold to be given you, which youwill be sure to remit to him', '\"So saying she gave orders for the payment and returned to the palace,having the jars carried before her', 'When evening came the PrincessBadoura retired to the inner part of the palace, and going to theapartments of the Princess Haiatelnefous she had the fifty jarsof olives brought to her', 'She opened one to let her friend tastethe olives and to taste them herself, but great was her surprise when,on pouring some into a dish, she found them all powdered withgold dust', '\"What an adventure', 'how extraordinary', '\" she cried', 'Then she had the other jars opened, and was more and more surprisedto find the olives in each jar mixed with gold dust', 'But when at length her talisman was discovered in one of the jarsher emotion was so great that she fainted away', 'The PrincessHaiatelnefous and her women hastened to restore her, and as soonas she recovered consciousness she covered the precious talismanwith kisses', 'Then, dismissing the attendants, she said to her friend:\"You will have guessed, my dear, that it was the sight of thistalisman which has moved me so deeply', 'This was the causeof my separation from my dear husband, and now, I am convinced,it will be the means of our reunion', '\"As soon as it was light next day the Princess Badoura sentfor the captain, and made further inquiries about the merchantwho owned the olive jars she had bought', 'In reply the captain told her all he knew of the place where theyoung man lived, and how, after engaging his passage, he cameto be left behind', '\"If that is the case,\" said the princess, \"you must set sailat once and go back for him', 'He is a debtor of mine and must bebrought here at once, or I will confiscate all your merchandise', 'I shall now give orders to have all the warehouses where your cargois placed under the royal seal, and they will only be opened when youhave brought me the man I ask for', 'Go at once and obey my orders', '\"The captain had no choice but to do as he was bid, so hastilyprovisioning his ship he started that same evening on his return voyage', \"When, after a rapid passage, he gained sight of the Island of Idolaters,he judged it better not to enter the harbour, but casting anchorat some distance he embarked at night in a small boat with sixactive sailors and landed near Camaralzaman's cottage\", 'The prince was not asleep, and as he lay awake moaning overall the sad events which had separated him from his wife,he thought he heard a knock at the garden door', 'He went toopen it, and was immediately seized by the captain and sailors,who without a word of explanation forcibly bore him off tothe boat, which took them back to the ship without loss of time', 'No sooner were they on board than they weighed anchor and set sail', 'Camaralzaman, who had kept silence till then, now asked the captain(whom he had recognised) the reason for this abduction', '\"Are you not a debtor of the King of the Ebony Island', '\" asked the captain', '\"I', 'Why, I never even heard of him before, and never set footin his kingdom', '\" was the answer', '\"Well, you must know better than I,\" said the captain', '\"You will soonsee him now, and meantime be content where you are and have patience', '\"The return voyage was as prosperous as the former one, and thoughit was night when the ship entered the harbour, the captain lost notime in landing with his passenger, whom he conducted to the palace,where he begged an audience with the king', 'Directly the Princess Badoura saw the prince she recognised him inspite of his shabby clothes', 'She longed to throw herself on his neck,but restrained herself, feeling it was better for them both thatshe should play her part a little longer', 'She therefore desiredone of her officers to take care of him and to treat him well', 'Next she ordered another officer to remove the seals from the warehouse,whilst she presented the captain with a costly diamond, and toldhim to keep the thousand pieces of gold paid for the olives,as she would arrange matters with the merchant himself', 'She then returned to her private apartments, where she told thePrincess Haiatelnefous all that had happened, as well as her plans forthe future, and begged her assistance, which her friend readily promised', 'Next morning she ordered the prince to be taken to the bath andclothed in a manner suitable to an emir or governor of a province', 'He was then introduced to the council, where his good looks and grandair drew the attention of all on him', 'Princess Badoura, delighted to see him looking himself once more,turned to the other emirs, saying:\"My lords, I introduce to you a new colleague, Camaralzaman, whom Ihave known on my travels and who, I can assure you, you will findwell deserves your regard and admiration', '\"Camaralzaman was much surprised at hearing the king--whom he neversuspected of being a woman in disguise--asserting their acquaintance,for he felt sure he had never seen her before', 'However hereceived all the praises bestowed on him with becoming modesty,and prostrating himself, said:\"Sire, I cannot find words in which to thank your Majestyfor the great honour conferred on me', 'I can but assureyou that I will do all in my power to prove myself worthy of it', '\"On leaving the council the prince was conducted to a splendid housewhich had been prepared for him, where he found a full establishmentand well-filled stables at his orders', 'On entering his study hissteward presented him with a coffer filled with gold pieces for hiscurrent expenses', 'He felt more and more puzzled by such good fortune,and little guessed that the Princess of China was the cause of it', 'After a few days the Princess Badoura promoted Camaralzaman to thepost of grand treasurer, an office which he filled with so muchintegrity and benevolence as to win universal esteem', 'He would now have thought himself the happiest of men had it notbeen for that separation which he never ceased to bewail', 'He hadno clue to the mystery of his present position, for the princess,out of compliment to the old king, had taken his name, and wasgenerally known as King Armanos the younger, few people rememberingthat on her first arrival she went by another name', \"At length the princess felt that the time had come to put an endto her own and the prince's suspense, and having arranged all herplans with the Princess Haiatelnefous, she informed Camaralzamanthat she wished his advice on some important business, and, to avoidbeing disturbed, desired him to come to the palace that evening\", 'The prince was punctual, and was received in the private apartment,when, having ordered her attendants to withdraw, the princess tookfrom a small box the talisman, and, handing it to Camaralzaman,said:  \"Not long ago an astrologer gave me this talisman', 'As youare universally well informed, you can perhaps tell me what is its use', '\"Camaralzaman took the talisman and, holding it to the light,cried with surprise, \"Sire, you ask me the use of this talisman', 'Alas', 'hitherto it has been only a source of misfortune to me,being the cause of my separation from the one I love best on earth', 'The story is so sad and strange that I am sure your Majesty will betouched by it if you will permit me to tell it you', '\"\"I will hear it some other time,\" replied the princess', '\"Meanwhile I fancy it is not quite unknown to me', 'Wait here for me', 'I will return shortly', '\"So saying she retired to another room, where she hastily changedher masculine attire for that of a woman, and, after putting onthe girdle she wore the day they parted, returned to Camaralzaman', 'The prince recognised her at once, and, embracing her with theutmost tenderness, cried, \"Ah, how can I thank the king for thisdelightful surprise', '\"\"Do not expect ever to see the king again,\" said the princess,as she wiped the tears of joy from her eyes, \"in me you see the king', 'Let us sit down, and I will tell you all about it', '\"She then gave a full account of all her adventures since their parting,and dwelt much on the charms and noble disposition of thePrincess Haiatelnefous, to whose friendly assistance she owedso much', \"When she had done she asked to hear the prince's story,and in this manner they spent most of the night\", \"Next morning the princess resumed her woman's clothes, and as soonas she was ready she desired the chief eunuch to beg King Armanosto come to her apartments\", 'When the king arrived great was his surprise at finding a strangelady in company of the grand treasurer who had no actual right toenter the private apartment', 'Seating himself he asked for the king', '\"Sire,\" said the princess, \"yesterday I was the king, to-day I amonly the Princess of China and wife to the real Prince Camaralzaman,son of King Schahzaman, and I trust that when your Majesty shallhave heard our story you will not condemn the innocent deception Ihave been obliged to practise', '\"The king consented to listen, and did so with marked surprise', 'At the close of her narrative the princess said, \"Sire, as our religionallows a man to have more than one wife, I would beg your Majestyto give your daughter, the Princess Haiatelnefous, in marriageto Prince Camaralzaman', 'I gladly yield to her the precedence andtitle of Queen in recognition of the debt of gratitude which I owe her', '\"King Armanos heard the princess with surprise and admiration,then, turning to Camaralzaman, he said, \"My son, as your wife,the Princess Badoura (whom I have hitherto looked on as my son-in-law),consents to share your hand and affections with my daughter,I have only to ask if this marriage is agreeable to you, and if youwill consent to accept the crown which the Princess Badoura deservesto wear all her life, but which she prefers to resign for love of you', '\"\"Sire,\" replied Camaralzaman, \"I can refuse your Majesty nothing', '\"Accordingly Camaralzaman was duly proclaimed king, and as dulymarried with all pomp to the Princess Haiatelnefous, with whosebeauty, talents, and affections he had every reason to be pleased', 'The two queens lived in true sisterly harmony together, and aftera time each presented King Camaralzaman with a son, whose birthswere celebrated throughout the kingdom with the utmost rejoicing', 'Noureddin and the Fair PersianBalsora was the capital of a kingdom long tributary to the caliph', 'During the time of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid the king of Balsora,who was his cousin, was called Zinebi', 'Not thinking one vizir enoughfor the administration of his estates he had two, named Khacanand Saouy', 'Khacan was kind, generous, and liberal, and took pleasurein obliging, as far as in him lay, those who had business with him', 'Throughout the entire kingdom there was no one who did not esteemand praise him as he deserved', 'Saouy was quite a different character, and repelled everyone withwhom he came in contact; he was always gloomy, and, in spite of hisgreat riches, so miserly that he denied himself even the necessariesof life', 'What made him particularly detested was the great aversionhe had to Khacan, of whom he never ceased to speak evil to the king', 'One day, while the king amused himself talking with his twovizirs and other members of the council, the conversation turnedon female slaves', 'While some declared that it sufficed for aslave to be beautiful, others, and Khacan was among the number,maintained that beauty alone was not enough, but that it mustbe accompanied by wit, wisdom, modesty, and, if possible, knowledge', 'The king not only declared himself to be of this opinion, but chargedKhacan to procure him a slave who should fulfil all these conditions', 'Saouy, who had been of the opposite side, and was jealous of thehonour done to Khacan, said, \"Sire, it will be very difficult to finda slave as accomplished as your Majesty desires, and, if she isto be found, she will be cheap if she cost less than 10,000 gold pieces', '\"\"Saouy,\" answered the king, \"you seem to find that a very great sum', 'For you it may be so, but not for me', '\"And forthwith he ordered his grand treasurer, who was present,to send 10,000 gold pieces to Khacan for the purchase of the slave', 'As soon, then, as Khacan returned home he sent for the dealers infemale slaves, and charged them directly they had found such a oneas he described to inform him', 'They promised to do their utmost,and no day passed that they did not bring a slave for his inspectionbut none was found without some defect', \"At length, early one morning, while Khacan was on his way to theking's palace, a dealer, throwing himself in his way, announced eagerlythat a Persian merchant, arrived late the previous evening, had aslave to sell whose wit and wisdom were equal to her incomparable beauty\", 'Khacan, overjoyed at this news, gave orders that the slave shouldbe brought for his inspection on his return from the palace', 'The dealer appearing at the appointed hour, Khacan found the slavebeautiful beyond his expectations, and immediately gave her the nameof \"The Fair Persian', '\"Being a man of great wisdom and learning, he perceived in the shortconversation he had with her that he would seek in vain anotherslave to surpass her in any of the qualities required by the king,and therefore asked the dealer what price the merchant put upon her', '\"Sir,\" was the answer, \"for less than 10,000 gold pieces he will notlet her go; he declares that, what with masters for her instruction,and for bodily exercises, not to speak of clothing and nourishment,he has already spent that sum upon her', 'She is in every way fit to bethe slave of a king; she plays every musical instrument, she sings,she dances, she makes verses, in fact there is no accomplishmentin which she does not excel', '\"Khacan, who was better able to judge of her merits than the dealer,wishing to bring the matter to a conclusion, sent for the merchant,and said to him, \"It is not for myself that I wish to buy your slave,but for the king', 'Her price, however, is too high', '\"\"Sir,\" replied the merchant, \"I should esteem it an honour to presenther to his Majesty, did it become a merchant to do such a thing', 'I ask no more than the sum it has cost me to make her such as she is', '\"Khacan, not wishing to bargain, immediately had the sum counted out,and given to the merchant, who before withdrawing said:\"Sir, as she is destined for the king, I would have you observethat she is extremely tired with the long journey, and beforepresenting her to his Majesty you would do well to keep hera fortnight in your own house, and to see that a little care isbestowed upon her', 'The sun has tanned her complexion, but when shehas been two or three times to the bath, and is fittingly dressed,you will see how much her beauty will be increased', '\"Khacan thanked the merchant for his advice, and determined to follow it', 'He gave the beautiful Persian an apartment near to that of his wife,whom he charged to treat her as befitting a lady destined for the king,and to order for her the most magnificent garments', 'Before bidding adieu to the fair Persian, he said to her: \"No happiness can be greater than what I have procured for you;judge for yourself, you now belong to the king', 'I have, however, to warnyou of one thing', 'I have a son, who, though not wanting in sense,is young, foolish, and headstrong, and I charge you to keep himat a distance', '\"The Persian thanked him for his advice, and promised to profitby it', \"Noureddin--for so the vizir's son was named--went freely in and outof his mother's apartments\", 'He was young, well-made and agreeable,and had the gift of charming all with whom he came in contact', 'As soon as he saw the beautiful Persian, though aware that she wasdestined for the king, he let himself be carried away by her charms,and determined at once to use every means in his power to retainher for himself', 'The Persian was equally captivated by Noureddin,and said to herself:  \"The vizir does me too great honour in buying mefor the king', 'I should esteem myself very happy if he would give meto his son', '\"Noureddin availed himself of every opportunity to gaze upon her beauty,to talk and laugh with her, and never would have left her sideif his mother had not forced him', \"Some time having elapsed, on account of the long journey, since thebeautiful Persian had been to the bath, five or six days after herpurchase the vizir's wife gave orders that the bath should be heatedfor her, and that her own female slaves should attend her there,and after-wards should array her in a magnificent dress that hadbeen prepared for her\", \"Her toilet completed, the beautiful Persian came to present herselfto the vizir's wife, who hardly recognised her, so greatly was herbeauty increased\", 'Kissing her hand, the beautiful slave said: \"Madam, I do not know how you find me in this dress that youhave had prepared for me; your women assure me that it suits meso well that they hardly knew me', 'If it is the truth they tell me,and not flattery, it is to you I owe the transformation', '\"\"My daughter,\" answered the vizir\\'s wife, \"they do not flatter you', 'I myself hardly recognised you', 'The improvement is not due to thedress alone, but largely to the beautifying effects of the bath', 'I am so struck by its results, that I would try it on myself', '\"Acting forthwith on this decision she ordered two little slavesduring her absence to watch over the beautiful Persian, and notto allow Noureddin to enter should he come', 'She had no sooner gone than he arrived, and not finding his motherin her apartment, would have sought her in that of the Persian', 'The two little slaves barred the entrance, saying that his mother hadgiven orders that he was not to be admitted', 'Taking each by an arm,he put them out of the anteroom, and shut the door', 'Then theyrushed to the bath, informing their mistress with shrieks and tearsthat Noureddin had driven them away by force and gone in', 'This news caused great consternation to the lady, who, dressingherself as quickly as possible, hastened to the apartment ofthe fair Persian, to find that Noureddin had already gone out', \"Much astonished to see the vizir's wife enter in tears,the Persian asked what misfortune had happened\", '\"What', '\" exclaimed the lady, \"you ask me that, knowing that my sonNoureddin has been alone with you', '\"\"But, madam,\" inquired the Persian, \"what harm is there in that', '\"\"How', 'Has my husband not told you that you are destined for the king', '\"\"Certainly, but Noureddin has just been to tell me that his fatherhas changed his mind and has bestowed me upon him', 'I believed him,and so great is my affection for Noureddin that I would willinglypass my life with him', '\"\"Would to heaven,\" exclaimed the wife of the vizir, \"that what yousay were true; but Noureddin has deceived you, and his fatherwill sacrifice him in vengeance for the wrong he has done', '\"So saying, she wept bitterly, and all her slaves wept with her', 'Khacan, entering shortly after this, was much astonished to find his wifeand her slaves in tears, and the beautiful Persian greatly perturbed', 'He inquired the cause, but for some time no answer was forthcoming', 'When his wife was at length sufficiently calm to inform himof what had happened, his rage and mortification knew no bounds', 'Wringing his hands and rending his beard, he exclaimed:\"Wretched son', 'thou destroyest not only thyself but thy father', 'The king will shed not only thy blood but mine', '\"  His wife triedto console him, saying:  \"Do not torment thyself', 'With the saleof my jewels I will obtain 10,000 gold pieces, and with this sum youwill buy another slave', '\"\"Do not suppose,\" replied her husband, \"that it is the loss of the moneythat affects me', 'My honour is at stake, and that is more preciousto me than all my wealth', 'You know that Saouy is my mortal enemy', 'He will relate all this to the king, and you will see the consequencesthat will ensue', '\"\"My lord,\" said his wife, \"I am quite aware of Saouy\\'s baseness,and that he is capable of playing you this malicious trick', 'But how can he or any one else know what takes place in this house', 'Even if you are suspected and the king accuses you, you have onlyto say that, after examining the slave, you did not find her worthyof his Majesty', 'Reassure yourself, and send to the dealers,saying that you are not satisfied, and wish them to find youanother slave', '\"This advice appearing reasonable, Khacan decided to follow it,but his wrath against his son did not abate', 'Noureddin darednot appear all that day, and fearing to take refuge with hisusual associates in case his father should seek him there,he spent the day in a secluded garden where he was not known', 'He did not return home till after his father had gone to bed,and went out early next morning before the vizir awoke, and theseprecautions he kept up during an entire month', 'His mother, though knowing very well that he returned to the houseevery evening, dare not ask her husband to pardon him', 'At lengthshe took courage and said:\"My lord, I know that a son could not act more basely towardshis father than Noureddin has done towards you, but afterall will you now pardon him', 'Do you not consider the harmyou may be doing yourself, and fear that malicious people,seeking the cause of your estrangement, may guess the real one', '\"\"Madam,\" replied the vizir, \"what you say is very just, but I cannotpardon Noureddin before I have mortified him as he deserves', '\"\"He will be sufficiently punished,\" answered the lady, \"if you doas I suggest', 'In the evening, when he returns home, lie in waitfor him and pretend that you will slay him', 'I will come to his aid,and while pointing out that you only yield his life at my supplications,you can force him to take the beautiful Persian on any conditionsyou please', '\"  Khacan agreed to follow this plan, and everythingtook place as arranged', 'On Noureddin\\'s return Khacan pretendedto be about to slay him, but yielding to his wife\\'s intercession,said to his son:\"You owe your life to your mother', 'I pardon you on her intercession,and on the conditions that you take the beautiful Persian for your wife,and not your slave, that you never sell her, nor put her away', '\"Noureddin, not hoping for so great indulgence, thanked his father,and vowed to do as he desired', \"Khacan was at great pains frequentlyto speak to the king of the difficulties attending the commission hehad given him, but some whispers of what had actually taken placedid reach Saouy's ears\", 'More than a year after these events the minister took a chill,leaving the bath while still heated to go out on important business', 'This resulted in inflammation of the lungs, which rapidly increased', 'The vizir, feeling that his end was at hand, sent for Noureddin,and charged him with his dying breath never to part with thebeautiful Persian', 'Shortly afterwards he expired, leaving universal regret throughoutthe kingdom; rich and poor alike followed him to the grave', \"Noureddin showed every mark of the deepest grief at his father's death,and for long refused to see any one\", 'At length a day came when,one of his friends being admitted, urged him strongly to be consoled,and to resume his former place in society', 'This advice Noureddinwas not slow to follow, and soon he formed little society of tenyoung men all about his own age, with whom he spent all his time incontinual feasting and merry-making', 'Sometimes the fair Persian consented to appear at these festivities,but she disapproved of this lavish expenditure, and did not scrupleto warn Noureddin of the probable consequences', 'He, however, onlylaughed at her advice, saying, that his father had always kept him intoo great constraint, and that now he rejoiced at his new-found liberty', 'What added to the confusion in his affairs was that he refusedto look into his accounts with his steward, sending him away everytime he appeared with his book', '\"See only that I live well,\" he said, \"and do not disturb me aboutanything else', '\"Not only did Noureddin\\'s friends constantly partake of his hospitality,but in every way they took advantage of his generosity; everything ofhis that they admired, whether land, houses, baths, or anyother source of his revenue, he immediately bestowed on them', 'In vain the Persian protested against the wrong he did himself;he continued to scatter with the same lavish hand', 'Throughout one entire year Noureddin did nothing but amuse himself,and dissipate the wealth his father had taken such pains to acquire', 'The year had barely elapsed, when one day, as they sat at table,there came a knock at the door', 'The slaves having been sent away,Noureddin went to open it himself', 'One of his friends had risen atthe same time, but Noureddin was before him, and finding the intruderto be the steward, he went out and closed the door', 'The friend,curious to hear what passed between them, hid himself behind the hangings,and heard the following words:\"My lord,\" said the steward, \"I beg a thousand pardons forinterrupting you, but what I have long foreseen has taken place', 'Nothing remains of the sums you gave me for your expenses, and allother sources of income are also at end, having been transferredby you to others', 'If you wish me to remain in your service,furnish me with the necessary funds, else I must withdraw', '\"So great was Noureddin\\'s consternation that he had not a wordto say in reply', 'The friend, who had been listening behind the curtain, immediatelyhastened to communicate the news to the rest of the company', '\"If this is so,\" they said, \"we must cease to come here', '\"Noureddin re-entering at that moment, they plainly saw, in spiteof his efforts to dissemble, that what they had heard was the truth', 'One by one they rose, and each with a different excuse left the room,till presently he found himself alone, though little suspecting theresolution his friends had taken', 'Then, seeing the beautiful Persian,he confided to her the statement of the steward, with many expressionsof regret for his own carelessness', '\"Had I but followed your advice, beautiful Persian,\" he said,\"all this would not have happened, but at least I have this consolation,that I have spent my fortune in the company of friends who willnot desert me in an hour of need', 'To-morrow I will go to them,and amongst them they will lend me a sum sufficient to startin some business', '\"Accordingly next morning early Noureddin went to seek his ten friends,who all lived in the same street', 'Knocking at the door of the firstand chief, the slave who opened it left him to wait in a hall whilehe announced his visit to his master', '\"Noureddin', '\" he heard himexclaim quite audibly', '\"Tell him, every time he calls, that I amnot at home', '\"  The same thing happened at the second door, and also atthe third, and so on with all the ten', 'Noureddin, much mortified,recognised too late that he had confided in false friends,who abandoned him in his hour of need', 'Overwhelmed with grief,he sought consolation from the beautiful Persian', '\"Alas, my lord,\" she said, \"at last you are convinced of the truthof what I foretold', 'There is now no other resource left but to sellyour slaves and your furniture', '\"First then he sold the slaves, and subsisted for a time on the proceeds,after that the furniture was sold, and as much of it was valuable itsufficed for some time', 'Finally this resource also came to an end,and again he sought counsel from the beautiful Persian', '\"My lord,\" she said, \"I know that the late vizir, your father,bought me for 10,000 gold pieces, and though I have diminishedin value since, I should still fetch a large sum', 'Do not thereforehesitate to sell me, and with the money you obtain go and establishyourself in business in some distant town', '\"\"Charming Persian,\" answered Noureddin, \"how could I be guiltyof such baseness', 'I would die rather than part from you whomI love better than my life', '\"\"My lord,\" she replied, \"I am well aware of your love for me,which is only equalled by mine for you, but a cruel necessityobliges us to seek the only remedy', '\"Noureddin, convinced at length of the truth of her words, yielded,and reluctantly led her to the slave market, where, showing herto a dealer named Hagi Hassan, he inquired her value', 'Taking them into a room apart, Hagi Hassan exclaimed as soon as shehad unveiled, \"My lord, is not this the slave your father boughtfor 10,000 pieces', '\"On learning that it was so, he promised to obtain the highest possibleprice for her', 'Leaving the beautiful Persian shut up in the room alone,he went out to seek the slave merchants, announcing to them that hehad found the pearl among slaves, and asking them to come and puta value upon her', 'As soon as they saw her they agreed that lessthan 4,000 gold pieces could not be asked', 'Hagi Hassan, then closingthe door upon her, began to offer her for sale--calling out: \"Who will bid 4,000 gold pieces for the Persian slave', '\"Before any of the merchants had bid, Saouy happened to pass that way,and judging that it must be a slave of extraordinary beauty, rode upto Hagi Hassan and desired to see her', 'Now it was not the customto show a slave to a private bidder, but as no one dared to disobeythe vizir his request was granted', 'As soon as Saouy saw the Persian he was so struck by her beauty,that he immediately wished to possess her, and not knowing that shebelonged to Noureddin, he desired Hagi Hassan to send for the ownerand to conclude the bargain at once', 'Hagi Hassan then sought Noureddin, and told him that his slavewas going far below her value, and that if Saouy bought her hewas capable of not paying the money', '\"What you must do,\" he said,\"is to pretend that you had no real intention of selling your slave,and only swore you would in a fit of anger against her', 'When Ipresent her to Saouy as if with your consent you must step in,and with blows begin to lead her away', '\"Noureddin did as Hagi Hassan advised, to the great wrath of Saouy,who riding straight at him endeavoured to take the beautiful Persianfrom him by force', \"Noureddin letting her go, seized Saouy's horseby the bridle, and, encouraged by the applause of the bystanders,dragged him to the ground, beat him severely, and left him in thegutter streaming with blood\", 'Then, taking the beautiful Persian,he returned home amidst the acclamations of the people, who detestedSaouy so much that they would neither interfere in his behalf norallow his slaves to protect him', 'Covered from head to foot with mire and streaming with blood he rose,and leaning on two of his slaves went straight to the palace,where he demanded an audience of the king, to whom he related whathad taken place in these words:\"May it please your Majesty, I had gone to the slave market to buy myselfa cook', 'While there I heard a slave being offered for 4,000 pieces', 'Asking to see her, I found she was of incomparable beauty,and was being sold by Noureddin, the son of your late vizir,to whom your Majesty will remember giving a sum of 10,000 goldpieces for the purchase of a slave', 'This is the identical slave,whom instead of bringing to your Majesty he gave to his own son', 'Since the death of his father this Noureddin has run through hisentire fortune, has sold all his possessions, and is now reducedto selling the slave', 'Calling him to me, I said:  \"Noureddin, Iwill give you 10,000 gold pieces for your slave, whom I will presentto the king', 'I will interest him at the same time in your behalf,and this will be worth much more to you than what extra money youmight obtain from the merchants', '\"  \"Bad old man,\" he exclaimed,\"rather than sell my slave to you I would give her to a Jew', '\" \"But, Noureddin,\" I remonstrated, \"you do not consider that in speakingthus you wrong the king, to whom your father owed everything', '\" This remonstrance only irritated him the more', \"Throwing himself on melike a madman, he tore me from my horse, beat me to his heart's content,and left me in the state your Majesty sees\", '\"So saying Saouy turned aside his head and wept bitterly', \"The king's wrath was kindled against Noureddin\", \"He ordered the captainof the guard to take with him forty men, to pillage Noureddin's house,to rase it to the ground, and to bring Noureddin and the slave to him\", \"A doorkeeper, named Sangiar, who had been a slave of Khacan's,hearing this order given, slipped out of the king's apartment,and hastened to warn Noureddin to take flight instantly with thebeautiful Persian\", 'Then, presenting him with forty gold pieces,he disappeared before Noureddin had time to thank him', 'As soon, then, as the fair Persian had put on her veil theyfled together, and had the good fortune to get out of the townwithout being observed', 'At the mouth of the Euphrates theyfound a ship just about to start for Bagdad', 'They embarked,and immediately the anchor was raised and they set sail', \"When the captain of the guard reached Noureddin's house he caused hissoldiers to burst open the door and to enter by force, but no trace wasto be found of Noureddin and his slave, nor could the neighbours giveany information about them\", 'When the king heard that they had escaped,he issued a proclamation that a reward of 1,000 gold pieces would begiven to whoever would bring him Noureddin and the slave, but that,on the contrary, whoever hid them would be severely punished', 'Meanwhile Noureddin and the fair Persian had safely reached Bagdad', 'When the vessel had come to an anchor they paid five gold pieces fortheir passage and went ashore', 'Never having been in Bagdad before,they did not know where to seek a lodging', 'Wandering along the banksof the Tigris, they skirted a garden enclosed by a high wall', 'The gate was shut, but in front of it was an open vestibule with a sofaon either side', '\"Here,\" said Noureddin, \"let us pass the night,\"and reclining on the sofas they soon fell asleep', 'Now this garden belonged to the Caliph', 'In the middle of it wasa vast pavilion, whose superb saloon had eighty windows, each windowhaving a lustre, lit solely when the Caliph spent the evening there', 'Only the door-keeper lived there, an old soldier named Scheih Ibrahim,who had strict orders to be very careful whom he admitted,and never to allow any one to sit on the sofas by the door', 'It happened that evening that he had gone out on an errand', 'When he came back and saw two persons asleep on the sofas he wasabout to drive them out with blows, but drawing nearer he perceivedthat they were a handsome young man and beautiful young woman,and decided to awake them by gentler means', 'Noureddin, on being awoke,told the old man that they were strangers, and merely wished to passthe night there', '\"Come with me,\" said Scheih Ibrahim, \"I will lodgeyou better, and will show you a magnificent garden belonging to me', '\" So saying the doorkeeper led the way into the Caliph\\'s garden,the beauties of which filled them with wonder and amazement', 'Noureddin took out two gold pieces, and giving them to Scheih Ibrahimsaid\"I beg you to get us something to eat that we may make merry together', '\" Being very avaricious, Scheih Ibrahim determined to spend onlythe tenth part of the money and to keep the rest to himself', 'While he was gone Noureddin and the Persian wandered through thegardens and went up the white marble staircase of the pavilion as faras the locked door of the saloon', 'On the return of Scheih Ibrahimthey begged him to open it, and to allow them to enter and admirethe magnificence within', 'Consenting, he brought not only the key,but a light, and immediately unlocked the door', 'Noureddin and thePersian entering, were dazzled with the magnificence they beheld', 'The paintings and furniture were of astonishing beauty, and betweeneach window was a silver arm holding a candle', 'Scheih Ibrahim spread the table in front of a sofa, and allthree ate together', 'When they had finished eating Noureddinasked the old man to bring them a bottle of wine', '\"Heaven forbid,\" said Scheih Ibrahim, \"that I should come in contactwith wine', 'I who have four times made the pilgrimage to Mecca,and have renounced wine for ever', '\"\"You would, however, do us a great service in procuringus some,\" said Noureddin', '\"You need not touch it yourself', \"Take the ass which is tied to the gate, lead it to the nearestwine-shop, and ask some passer-by to order two jars of wine;have them put in the ass's panniers, and drive him before you\", 'Here are two pieces of gold for the expenses', '\"At sight of the gold, Scheih Ibrahim set off at once to executethe commission', 'On his return, Noureddin said:  \"We have still needof cups to drink from, and of fruit, if you can procure us some', '\" Scheih Ibrahim disappeared again, and soon returned with a table spreadwith cups of gold and silver, and every sort of beautiful fruit', 'Then he withdrew, in spite of repeated invitations to remain', 'Noureddin and the beautiful Persian, finding the wine excellent,drank of it freely, and while drinking they sang', 'Both had finevoices, and Scheih Ibrahim listened to them with great pleasure--first from a distance, then he drew nearer, and finally put hishead in at the door', 'Noureddin, seeing him, called to him to comein and keep them company', 'At first the old man declined, but waspersuaded to enter the room, to sit down on the edge of the sofanearest the door, and at last to draw closer and to seat himselfby the beautiful Persian, who urged him so persistently to drinkher health that at length he yielded, and took the cup she offered', 'Now the old man only made a pretence of renouncing wine;he frequented wine-shops like other people, and had taken noneof the precautions Noureddin had proposed', 'Having once yielded,he was easily persuaded to take a second cup, and a third,and so on till he no longer knew what he was doing', 'Till nearmidnight they continued drinking, laughing, and singing together', 'About that time the Persian, perceiving that the room was litby only one miserable tallow candle, asked Scheih Ibrahim to lightsome of the beautiful candles in the silver arms', '\"Light them yourself,\" answered the old man; \"you are younger than I,but let five or six be enough', '\"She did not stop, however, till she had lit all the eighty, but ScheihIbrahim was not conscious of this, and when, soon after that,Noureddin proposed to have some of the lustres lit, he answered:\"You are more capable of lighting them than I, but not more than three', '\"Noureddin, far from contenting himself with three, lit all,and opened all the eighty windows', 'The Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, chancing at that moment to opena window in the saloon of his palace looking on the garden,was surprised to see the pavilion brilliantly illuminated', 'Calling the grand-vizir, Giafar, he said to him:\"Negligent vizir, look at the pavilion, and tell me why it is litup when I am not there', '\"When the vizir saw that it was as the Caliph said, he trembledwith fear, and immediately invented an excuse', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" he said, \"I must tell you that fouror five days ago Scheih Ibrahim told me that he wished to havean assembly of the ministers of his mosque, and asked permissionto hold it in the pavilion', 'I granted his request, but forgotsince to mention it to your Majesty', '\"\"Giafar,\" replied the Caliph, \"you have committed three faults--first, in giving the permission; second, in not mentioning itto me; and third, in not investigating the matter more closely', 'For punishment I condemn you to spend the rest of the night with mein company of these worthy people', 'While I dress myself as a citizen,go and disguise yourself, and then come with me', '\"When they reached the garden gate they found it open, to the greatindignation of the Caliph', 'The door of the pavilion being also open,he went softly upstairs, and looked in at the half-closed doorof the saloon', 'Great was his surprise to see Scheih Ibrahim,whose sobriety he had never doubted, drinking and singing with a youngman and a beautiful lady', 'The Caliph, before giving way to his anger,determined to watch and see who the people were and what they did', 'Presently Scheih Ibrahim asked the beautiful Persian if anythingwere wanting to complete her enjoyment of the evening', '\"If only,\" she said, \"I had an instrument upon which I might play', '\"Scheih Ibrahim immediately took a lute from a cup-board and gaveit to the Persian, who began to play on it, singing the whilewith such skill and taste that the Caliph was enchanted', 'When she ceased he went softly downstairs and said to the vizir:\"Never have I heard a finer voice, nor the lute better played', 'I am determined to go in and make her play to me', '\"\"Commander of the Faithful,\" said the vizir, \"if Scheih Ibrahimrecognises you he will die of fright', '\"\"I should be sorry for that,\" answered the Caliph, \"and I am goingto take steps to prevent it', 'Wait here till I return', '\"Now the Caliph had caused a bend in the river to form a lake inhis garden', 'There the finest fish in the Tigris were to be found,but fishing was strictly forbidden', 'It happened that night,however, that a fisherman had taken advantage of the gate beingopen to go in and cast his nets', 'He was just about to draw themwhen he saw the Caliph approaching', 'Recognising him at once in spiteof his disguise, he threw himself at his feet imploring forgiveness', '\"Fear nothing,\" said the Caliph, \"only rise up and draw thy nets', '\"The fisherman did as he was told, and produced five or six fine fish,of which the Caliph took the two largest', 'Then he desired thefisherman to change clothes with him, and in a few minutes the Caliphwas transformed into a fisherman, even to the shoes and the turban', 'Taking the two fish in his hand, he returned to the vizir, who,not recognising him, would have sent him about his business', 'Leaving the vizir at the foot of the stairs, the Caliph went upand knocked at the door of the saloon', 'Noureddin opened it,and the Caliph, standing on the threshold, said:\"Scheih Ibrahim, I am the fisher Kerim', 'Seeing that you are feastingwith your friends, I bring you these fish', '\"Noureddin and the Persian said that when the fishes were properlycooked and dressed they would gladly eat of them', \"The Caliph thenreturned to the vizir, and they set to work in Scheih Ibrahim'shouse to cook the fish, of which they made so tempting a dishthat Noureddin and the fair Persian ate of it with great relish\", 'When they had finished Noureddin took thirty gold pieces (allthat remained of what Sangiar had given him) and presented them tothe Caliph, who, thanking him, asked as a further favour if the ladywould play him one piece on the lute', 'The Persian gladly consented,and sang and played so as to delight the Caliph', 'Noureddin, in the habit of giving to others whatever they admired,said, \"Fisherman, as she pleases you so much, take her; she is yours', '\"The fair Persian, astounded that he should wish to part from her,took her lute, and with tears in her eyes sang her reproaches toits music', 'The Caliph (still in the character of fisherman) said to him,\"Sir, I perceive that this fair lady is your slave', 'Oblige me,I beg you, by relating your history', '\"Noureddin willingly granted this request, and recounted everythingfrom the purchase of the slave down to the present moment', '\"And where do you go now', '\" asked the Caliph', '\"Wherever the hand of Allah leads me,\" said Noureddin', '\"Then, if you will listen to me,\" said the Caliph, \"you willimmediately return to Balsora', 'I will give you a letter to the king,which will ensure you a good reception from him', '\"\"It is an unheard-of thing,\" said Noureddin, \"that a fishermanshould be in correspondence with a king', '\"\"Let not that astonish you,\" answered the Caliph; \"we studied together,and have always remained the best of friends, though fortune,while making him a king, left me a humble fisherman', '\"The Caliph then took a sheet of paper, and wrote the following letter,at the top of which he put in very small characters this formulato show that he must be implicitly obeyed:--\"In the name of the MostMerciful God', '\"\"Letter of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid to the King of Balsora', '\"\"Haroun-al-Raschid, son of Mahdi, sends this letter to Mohammed Zinebi,his cousin', 'As soon as Noureddin, son of the Vizir Khacan,bearer of this letter, has given it to thee, and thou hast read it,take off thy royal mantle, put it on his shoulders, and seat himin thy place without fail', 'Farewell', '\"The Caliph then gave this letter to Noureddin, who immediatelyset off, with only what little money he possessed when Sangiarcame to his assistance', 'The beautiful Persian, inconsolable athis departure, sank on a sofa bathed in tears', 'When Noureddin had left the room, Scheih Ibrahim, who had hithertokept silence, said:  \"Kerim, for two miserable fish thou hastreceived a purse and a slave', 'I tell thee I will take the slave,and as to the purse, if it contains silver thou mayst keep one piece,if gold then I will take all and give thee what copper pieces Ihave in my purse', '\"Now here it must be related that when the Caliph went upstairswith the plate of fish he ordered the vizir to hasten to the palaceand bring back four slaves bearing a change of raiment, who shouldwait outside the pavilion till the Caliph should clap his hands', 'Still personating the fisherman, the Caliph answered: \"Scheih Ibrahim, whatever is in the purse I will share equallywith you, but as to the slave I will keep her for myself', 'If you do not agree to these conditions you shall have nothing', '\"The old man, furious at this insolence as he considered it,took a cup and threw it at the Caliph, who easily avoided a missilefrom the hand of a drunken man', 'It hit against the wall, and brokeinto a thousand pieces', 'Scheih Ibrahim, still more enraged,then went out to fetch a stick', \"The Caliph at that moment clappedhis hands, and the vizir and the four slaves entering took offthe fisherman's dress and put on him that which they had brought\", 'When Scheih Ibrahim returned, a thick stick in his hand, the Caliphwas seated on his throne, and nothing remained of the fishermanbut his clothes in the middle of the room', 'Throwing himself on theground at the Caliph\\'s feet, he said:  \"Commander of the Faithful,your miserable slave has offended you, and craves forgiveness', '\"The Caliph came down from his throne, and said:  \"Rise, I forgive thee', '\" Then turning to the Persian he said:  \"Fair lady, now you know whoI am; learn also that I have sent Noureddin to Balsora to be king,and as soon as all necessary preparations are made I will sendyou there to be queen', 'Meanwhile I will give you an apartmentin my palace, where you will be treated with all honour', '\"At this the beautiful Persian took courage, and the Caliph was asgood as his word, recommending her to the care of his wife Zobeida', 'Noureddin made all haste on his journey to Balsora, and on hisarrival there went straight to the palace of the king, of whom hedemanded an audience', 'It was immediately granted, and holdingthe letter high above his head he forced his way through the crowd', 'While the king read the letter he changed colour', \"He would instantlyhave executed the Caliph's order, but first he showed the letterto Saouy, whose interests were equally at stake with his own\", 'Pretending that he wished to read it a second time, Saouy turnedaside as if to seek a better light; unperceived by anyone he toreoff the formula from the top of the letter, put it to his mouth,and swallowed it', 'Then, turning to the king, he said:\"Your majesty has no need to obey this letter', 'The writing is indeedthat of the Caliph, but the formula is absent', 'Besides, he has notsent an express with the patent, without which the letter is useless', 'Leave all to me, and I will take the consequences', '\"The king not only listened to the persuasions of Saouy, but gaveNoureddin into his hands', 'Such a severe bastinado was firstadministered to him, that he was left more dead than alive; then Saouythrew him into the darkest and deepest dungeon, and fed him onlyon bread and water', \"After ten days Saouy determined to put an endto Noureddin's life, but dared not without the king's authority\", 'To gain this end, he loaded several of his own slaves with rich gifts,and presented himself at their head to the king, saying that theywere from the new king on his coronation', '\"What', '\" said the king; \"is that wretch still alive', 'Go and beheadhim at once', 'I authorise you', '\"\"Sire,\" said Saouy, \"I thank your Majesty for the justice youdo me', 'I would further beg, as Noureddin publicly affronted me,that the execution might be in front of the palace, and that itmight be proclaimed throughout the city, so that no one may beignorant of it', '\"The king granted these requests, and the announcement causeduniversal grief, for the memory of Noureddin\\'s father was still freshin the hearts of his people', 'Saouy, accompanied by twenty of hisown slaves, went to the prison to fetch Noureddin, whom he mounted ona wretched horse without a saddle', \"Arrived at the palace, Saouy wentin to the king, leaving Noureddin in the square, hemmed in not onlyby Saouy's slaves but by the royal guard, who had great difficultyin preventing the people from rushing in and rescuing Noureddin\", 'So great was the indignation against Saouy that if anyone had setthe example he would have been stoned on his way through the streets', \"Saouy, who witnessed the agitation of the people from the windowsof the king's privy chambers, called to the executioner to strikeat once\", \"The king, however, ordered him to delay; not only washe jealous of Saouy's interference, but he had another reason\", 'A troop of horsemen was seen at that moment riding at full galloptowards the square', 'Saouy suspected who they might be, and urgedthe king to give the signal for the execution without delay,but this the king refused to do till he knew who the horsemen were', 'Now, they were the vizir Giafar and his suite arriving at full speedfrom Bagdad', \"For several days after Noureddin's departure with theletter the Caliph had forgotten to send the express with the patent,without which the letter was useless\", \"Hearing a beautiful voiceone day in the women's part of the palace uttering lamentations,he was informed that it was the voice of the fair Persian,and suddenly calling to mind the patent, he sent for Giafar,and ordered him to make for Balsora with the utmost speed--if Noureddin were dead, to hang Saouy; if he were still alive,to bring him at once to Bagdad along with the king and Saouy\", 'Giafar rode at full speed through the square, and alightedat the steps of the palace, where the king came to greet him', \"The vizir's first question was whether Noureddin were still alive\", 'The king replied that he was, and he was immediately led forth,though bound hand and foot', \"By the vizir's orders his bondswere immediately undone, and Saouy was tied with the same cords\", 'Next day Giafar returned to Bagdad, bearing with him the king, Saouy,and Noureddin', 'When the Caliph heard what treatment Noureddin had received,he authorised him to behead Saouy with his own hands, but hedeclined to shed the blood of his enemy, who was forthwith handedover to the executioner', 'The Caliph also desired Noureddin to reignover Balsora, but this, too, he declined, saying that after what hadpassed there he preferred never to return, but to enter the serviceof the Caliph', 'He became one of his most intimate courtiers, and livedlong in great happiness with the fair Persian', 'As to the king,the Caliph contented himself with sending him back to Balsora, with therecommendation to be more careful in future in the choice of his vizir', 'Aladdin and the Wonderful LampThere once lived a poor tailor, who had a son called Aladdin,a careless, idle boy who would do nothing but play all day longin the streets with little idle boys like himself', \"This so grievedthe father that he died; yet, in spite of his mother's tearsand prayers, Aladdin did not mend his ways\", 'One day, when hewas playing in the streets as usual, a stranger asked him his age,and if he were not the son of Mustapha the tailor', '\"I am, sir,\" replied Aladdin; \"but he died a long while ago', '\"On this the stranger, who was a famous African magician, fell on hisneck and kissed him, saying:  \"I am your uncle, and knew you from yourlikeness to my brother', 'Go to your mother and tell her I am coming', '\"Aladdin ran home, and told his mother of his newly found uncle', '\"Indeed, child,\" she said, \"your father had a brother, but I alwaysthought he was dead', '\"However, she prepared supper, and bade Aladdin seek his uncle,who came laden with wine and fruit', \"He presently fell down and kissedthe place where Mustapha used to sit, bidding Aladdin's mother notto be surprised at not having seen him before, as he had been fortyyears out of the country\", 'He then turned to Aladdin, and asked himhis trade, at which the boy hung his head, while his mother burstinto tears', 'On learning that Aladdin was idle and would learn no trade,he offered to take a shop for him and stock it with merchandise', 'next day he bought Aladdin a fine suit of clothes, and took himall over the city, showing him the sights, and brought him home atnightfall to his mother, who was overjoyed to see her son so fine', 'Next day the magician led Aladdin into some beautiful gardensa long way outside the city gates', 'They sat down by a fountain,and the magician pulled a cake from his girdle, which he dividedbetween them', 'They then journeyed onwards till they almost reachedthe mountains', 'Aladdin was so tired that he begged to go back,but the magician beguiled him with pleasant stories, and led him onin spite of himself', 'At last they came to two mountains divided by a narrow valley', '\"We will go no farther,\" said the false uncle', '\"I will show yousomething wonderful; only do you gather up sticks while I kindlea fire', '\"When it was lit the magician threw on it a powder he had about him,at the same time saying some magical words', 'The earth trembled a littleand opened in front of them, disclosing a square flat stone with abrass ring in the middle to raise it by', 'Aladdin tried to run away,but the magician caught him and gave him a blow that knocked him down', '\"What have I done, uncle', '\" he said piteously; whereupon the magiciansaid more kindly:  \"Fear nothing, but obey me', 'Beneath this stonelies a treasure which is to be yours, and no one else may touch it,so you must do exactly as I tell you', '\"At the word treasure, Aladdin forgot his fears, and grasped the ringas he was told, saying the names of his father and grandfather', 'The stone came up quite easily and some steps appeared', '\"Go down,\" said the magician; \"at the foot of those steps you will findan open door leading into three large halls', 'Tuck up your gown and gothrough them without touching anything, or you will die instantly', 'These halls lead into a garden of fine fruit trees', 'Walk on tillyou come to a niche in a terrace where stands a lighted lamp', 'Pour out the oil it contains and bring it to me', '\"He drew a ring from his finger and gave it to Aladdin,bidding him prosper', 'Aladdin found everything as the magician had said, gathered somefruit off the trees, and, having got the lamp, arrived at the mouthof the cave', 'The magician cried out in a great hurry:\"Make haste and give me the lamp', '\"  This Aladdin refused to do untilhe was out of the cave', 'The magician flew into a terrible passion,and throwing some more powder on the fire, he said something,and the stone rolled back into its place', \"The magician left Persia for ever, which plainly showed that hewas no uncle of Aladdin's, but a cunning magician who had read inhis magic books of a wonderful lamp, which would make him the mostpowerful man in the world\", 'Though he alone knew where to find it,he could only receive it from the hand of another', 'He had pickedout the foolish Aladdin for this purpose, intending to get the lampand kill him afterwards', 'For two days Aladdin remained in the dark, crying and lamenting', 'At last he clasped his hands in prayer, and in so doing rubbed the ring,which the magician had forgotten to take from him', 'Immediately anenormous and frightful genie rose out of the earth, saying:\"What wouldst thou with me', 'I am the Slave of the Ring, and willobey thee in all things', '\"Aladdin fearlessly replied:  \"Deliver me from this place', '\"whereupon the earth opened, and he found himself outside', 'As soon as his eyes could bear the light he went home, but faintedon the threshold', 'When he came to himself he told his motherwhat had passed, and showed her the lamp and the fruits he hadgathered in the garden, which were in reality precious stones', 'He then asked for some food', '\"Alas', 'child,\" she said, \"I have nothing in the house, but I havespun a little cotton and will go and sell it', '\"Aladdin bade her keep her cotton, for he would sell the lamp instead', 'As it was very dirty she began to rub it, that it might fetch ahigher price', 'Instantly a hideous genie appeared, and asked what shewould have', 'She fainted away, but Aladdin, snatching the lamp,said boldly:\"Fetch me something to eat', '\"The genie returned with a silver bowl, twelve silver platescontaining rich meats, two silver cups, and two bottles of wine', 'Aladdin\\'s mother, when she came to her-self, said:\"Whence comes this splendid feast', '\"\"Ask not, but eat,\" replied Aladdin', 'So they sat at breakfast till it was dinner-time, and Aladdintold his mother about the lamp', 'She begged him to sell it,and have nothing to do with devils', '\"No,\" said Aladdin, \"since chance has made us aware of its virtues,we will use it and the ring likewise, which I shall always wearon my finger', '\"  When they had eaten all the genie had brought,Aladdin sold one of the silver plates, and so on till none were left', 'He then had recourse to the genie, who gave him another set of plates,and thus they lived for many years', 'One day Aladdin heard an order from the Sultan proclaimed that everyonewas to stay at home and close his shutters while the princess,his daughter, went to and from the bath', 'Aladdin was seized by a desireto see her face, which was very difficult, as she always went veiled', 'He hid himself behind the door of the bath, and peeped througha chink', 'The princess lifted her veil as she went in, and lookedso beautiful that Aladdin fell in love with her at first sight', 'He went home so changed that his mother was frightened', 'He told herhe loved the princess so deeply that he could not live without her,and meant to ask her in marriage of her father', 'His mother,on hearing this, burst out laughing, but Aladdin at last prevailedupon her to go before the Sultan and carry his request', 'She fetcheda napkin and laid in it the

the lords of council had just gone in as sheentered the hall and placed herself in front of the Sultan', 'He, however, took no notice of her', 'She went every day for a week,and stood in the same place', 'When the council broke up on the sixth day the Sultan saidto his vizir:  \"I see a certain woman in the audience-chamberevery day carrying something in a napkin', 'Call her next time,that I may find out what she wants', '\"Next day, at a sign from the vizir, she went up to the foot ofthe throne, and remained kneeling till the Sultan said to her: \"Rise, good woman, and tell me what you

his will', '\"Save my life, genie,\" said Aladdin, \"and bring my palace back', '\"\"That is not in my power,\" said the genie; \"I am only the slaveof the ring; you must ask the slave of the lamp', '\"\"Even so,\" said Aladdin \"but thou canst take me to the palace,and set me down under my dear wife\\'s window', '\"  He at once foundhimself in Africa, under the window of the princess, and fell asleepout of sheer weariness', 'He was awakened by the singing of the birds, and his heart was lighter', 'He saw plainly that all his misfortunes were owing to the lossof the lamp, and vainly wondered who had robbed him of it', 'That morning the princess rose earlier than she had done since shehad been carried into Africa by the magician, whose company she wasforced to endure once a day', 'She, however, treated him so harshlythat he dared not live there altogether', 'As she was dressing,one of her women looked out and saw Aladdin', 'The princess ranand opened the window, and at the noise she made Aladdin looked up', 'She called to him to come to her, and great was the joy of theselovers at seeing each other again', 'After he had kissed her Aladdin said:  \"I beg of you, Princess,in God\\'s name, before we speak of anything else, for your own sakeand mine, tell me what has become of an old lamp I left on thecornice in the hall of four-and-twenty windows, when I went a-hunting', '\"\"Alas', '\" she said \"I am the innocent cause of our sorrows,\" and toldhim of the exchange of the lamp', '\"Now I know,\" cried Aladdin, \"that we have to thank the Africanmagician for this', 'Where is the lamp', '\"\"He carries it about with him,\" said the princess, \"I know, for hepulled it out of his breast to show me', \"He wishes me to breakmy faith with you and marry him, saying that you were beheadedby my father's command\", 'He is for ever speaking ill of you,but I only reply by my tears', 'If I persist, I doubt not that hewill use violence', '\"Aladdin comforted her, and left her for a while', 'He changed clotheswith the first person he met in the town, and having bought a certainpowder returned to the princess, who let him in by a little side door', '\"Put on your most beautiful dress,\" he said to her, \"and receivethe magician with smiles, leading him to believe that youhave forgotten me', 'Invite him to sup with you, and say youwish to taste the wine of his country', 'He will go for some,and while he is gone I will tell you what to do', '\"She listened carefully to Aladdin, and when he left her arrayedherself gaily for the first time since she left China', 'She puton a girdle and head-dress of diamonds, and seeing in a glassthat she looked more beautiful than ever, received the magician,saying to his great amazement:  \"I have made up my mind that Aladdinis dead, and that all my tears will not bring him back to me,so I am resolved to mourn no more, and have therefore invited youto sup with me; but I am tired of the wines of China, and wouldfain taste those of Africa', '\"The magician flew to his cellar, and the princess put the powderAladdin had given her in her cup', 'When he returned she asked himto drink her health in the wine of Africa, handing him her cupin exchange for his as a sign she was reconciled to him', 'Before drinking the magician made her a speech in praise of her beauty,but the princess cut him short saying:\"Let me drink first, and you shall say what you will afterwards', '\" She set her cup to her lips and kept it there, while the magiciandrained his to the dregs and fell back lifeless', 'The princess then opened the door to Aladdin, and flung her armsround his neck, but Aladdin put her away, bidding her to leave him,as he had more to do', 'He then went to the dead magician, took thelamp out of his vest, and bade the genie carry the palace and allin it back to China', 'This was done, and the princess in her chamberonly felt two little shocks, and little thought she was at home again', 'The Sultan, who was sitting in his closet, mourning for hislost daughter, happened to look up, and rubbed his eyes,for there stood the palace as before', 'He hastened thither,and Aladdin received him in the hall of the four-and-twenty windows,with the princess at his side', 'Aladdin told him what had happened,and showed him the dead body of the magician, that he might believe', \"A ten days' feast was proclaimed, and it seemed as if Aladdinmight now live the rest of his life in peace; but it was not to be\", 'The African magician had a younger brother, who was, if possible,more wicked and more cunning than himself', \"He travelled to Chinato avenge his brother's death, and went to visit a pious womancalled Fatima, thinking she might be of use to him\", 'He enteredher cell and clapped a dagger to her breast, telling her to riseand do his bidding on pain of death', 'He changed clothes with her,coloured his face like hers, put on her veil and murdered her,that she might tell no tales', 'Then he went towards the palaceof Aladdin, and all the people thinking he was the holy woman,gathered round him, kissing his hands and begging his blessing', 'When he got to the palace there was such a noise going on round himthat the princess bade her slave look out of the window and ask whatwas the matter', 'The slave said it was the holy woman, curing peopleby her touch of their ailments, whereupon the princess, who had longdesired to see Fatima, sent for her', 'On coming to the princessthe magician offered up a prayer for her health and prosperity', 'When he had done the princess made him sit by her, and begged himto stay with her always', 'The false Fatima, who wished for nothingbetter, consented, but kept his veil down for fear of discovery', 'The princess showed him the hall, and asked him what he thoughtof it', '\"It is truly beautiful,\" said the false Fatima', '\"In my mind itwants but one thing', '\"\"And what is that', '\" said the princess', '\"If only a roc\\'s egg,\" replied he, \"were hung up from the middleof this dome, it would be the wonder of the world', '\"After this the princess could think of nothing but a roc\\'s egg,and when Aladdin returned from hunting he found her in a veryill humour', \"He begged to know what was amiss, and she toldhim that all her pleasure in the hall was spoilt for the wantof a roc's egg hanging from the dome\", '\"It that is all,\" replied Aladdin, \"you shall soon be happy', '\"He left her and rubbed the lamp, and when the genie appearedcommanded him to bring a roc\\'s egg', 'The genie gave such a loudand terrible shriek that the hall shook', '\"Wretch', '\" he cried, \"is it not enough that I have done everythingfor you, but you must command me to bring my master and hang himup in the midst of this dome', 'You and your wife and your palacedeserve to be burnt to ashes; but this request does not come from you,but from the brother of the African magician whom you destroyed', 'He is now in your palace disguised as the holy woman--whom he murdered', \"He it was who put that wish into your wife's head\", 'Take care of yourself,for he means to kill you', '\"  So saying the genie disappeared', 'Aladdin went back to the princess, saying his head ached, and requestingthat the holy Fatima should be fetched to lay her hands on it', 'But when the magician came near, Aladdin, seizing his dagger,pierced him to the heart', '\"What have you done', '\" cried the princess', '\"You have killedthe holy woman', '\"\"Not so,\" replied Aladdin, \"but a wicked magician,\" and told herof how she had been deceived', 'After this Aladdin and his wife lived in peace', 'He succeededthe Sultan when he died, and reigned for many years, leaving behindhim a long line of kings', \"The Adventures of Haroun-al-Raschid, Caliph of BagdadThe Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid sat in his palace, wondering if there wasanything left in the world that could possibly give him a few hours'amusement, when Giafar the grand-vizir, his old and tried friend,suddenly appeared before him\", 'Bowing low, he waited, as was his duty,till his master spoke, but Haroun-al-Raschid merely turned hishead and looked at him, and sank back into his former weary posture', 'Now Giafar had something of importance to say to the Caliph,and had no intention of being put off by mere silence, so withanother low bow in front of the throne, he began to speak', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" said he, \"I have taken on myself toremind your Highness that you have undertaken secretly to observefor yourself the manner in which justice is done and order is keptthroughout the city', 'This is the day you have set apart to devoteto this object, and perhaps in fulfilling this duty you may findsome distraction from the melancholy to which, as I see to my sorrow,you are a prey', '\"\"You are right,\" returned the Caliph, \"I had forgotten all about it', 'Go and change your coat, and I will change mine', '\"A few moments later they both re-entered the hall, disguised asforeign merchants, and passed through a secret door, out into theopen country', 'Here they turned towards the Euphrates, and crossingthe river in a small boat, walked through that part of the townwhich lay along the further bank, without seeing anything to callfor their interference', 'Much pleased with the peace and good orderof the city, the Caliph and his vizir made their way to a bridge,which led straight back to the palace, and had already crossed it,when they were stopped by an old and blind man, who begged for alms', 'The Caliph gave him a piece of money, and was passing on,but the blind man seized his hand, and held him fast', '\"Charitable person,\" he said, \"whoever you may be grant me yetanother prayer', 'Strike me, I beg of you, one blow', 'I have deservedit richly, and even a more severe penalty', '\"The Caliph, much surprised at this request, replied gently: \"My good man, that which you ask is impossible', 'Of what use wouldmy alms be if I treated you so ill', '\"  And as he spoke he triedto loosen the grasp of the blind beggar', '\"My lord,\" answered the man, \"pardon my boldness and my persistence', 'Take back your money, or give me the blow which I crave', 'I have sworn a solemn oath that I will receive nothing withoutreceiving chastisement, and if you knew all, you would feel thatthe punishment is not a tenth part of what I deserve', '\"Moved by these words, and perhaps still more by the fact that hehad other business to attend to, the Caliph yielded, and struck himlightly on the shoulder', 'Then he continued his road, followed bythe blessing of the blind man', 'When they were out of earshot,he said to the vizir, \"There must be something very odd to makethat man act so--I should like to find out what is the reason', 'Go back to him; tell him who I am, and order him to come without failto the palace to-morrow, after the hour of evening prayer', '\"So the grand-vizir went back to the bridge; gave the blind beggarfirst a piece of money and then a blow, delivered the Caliph\\'s message,and rejoined his master', 'They passed on towards the palace, but walking through a square,they came upon a crowd watching a young and well-dressed manwho was urging a horse at full speed round the open space,using at the same time his spurs and whip so unmercifully thatthe animal was all covered with foam and blood', 'The Caliph,astonished at this proceeding, inquired of a passer-by what itall meant, but no one could tell him anything, except that everyday at the same hour the same thing took place', 'Still wondering, he passed on, and for the moment had tocontent himself with telling the vizir to command the horsemanalso to appear before him at the same time as the blind man', 'The next day, after evening prayer, the Caliph entered the hall,and was followed by the vizir bringing with him the two men of whomwe have spoken, and a third, with whom we have nothing to do', 'They all bowed themselves low before the throne and then the Caliphbade them rise, and ask the blind man his name', '\"Baba-Abdalla, your Highness,\" said he', '\"Baba-Abdalla,\" returned the Caliph, \"your way of asking almsyesterday seemed to me so strange, that I almost commanded youthen and there to cease from causing such a public scandal', 'But I have sent for you to inquire what was your motive in makingsuch a curious vow', 'When I know the reason I shall be able to judgewhether you can be permitted to continue to practise it, for Icannot help thinking that it sets a very bad example to others', 'Tell me therefore the whole truth, and conceal nothing', '\"These words troubled the heart of Baba-Abdalla, who prostratedhimself at the feet of the Caliph', 'Then rising, he answered: \"Commander of the Faithful, I crave your pardon humbly,for my persistence in beseeching your Highness to do an actionwhich appears on the face of it to be without any meaning', 'No doubt, in the eyes of men, it has none; but I look on it as aslight expiation for a fearful sin of which I have been guilty,and if your Highness will deign to listen to my tale, you willsee that no punishment could atone for the crime', '\"Story of the Blind Baba-AbdallaI was born, Commander of the Faithful, in Bagdad, and was leftan orphan while I was yet a very young man, for my parents diedwithin a few days of each other', 'I had inherited from thema small fortune, which I worked hard night and day to increase,till at last I found myself the owner of eighty camels', 'These Ihired out to travelling merchants, whom I frequently accompaniedon their various journeys, and always returned with large profits', 'One day I was coming back from Balsora, whither I had taken a supplyof goods, intended for India, and halted at noon in a lonely place,which promised rich pasture for my camels', 'I was resting in theshade under a tree, when a dervish, going on foot towards Balsora,sat down by my side, and I inquired whence he had come and to whatplace he was going', 'We soon made friends, and after we had askedeach other the usual questions, we produced the food we had with us,and satisfied our hunger', 'While we were eating, the dervish happened to mention that in a spotonly a little way off from where we were sitting, there was hiddena treasure so great that if my eighty camels were loaded till theycould carry no more, the hiding place would seem as full as if ithad never been touched', 'At this news I became almost beside myself with joy and greed, and Iflung my arms round the neck of the dervish, exclaiming:  \"Good dervish,I see plainly that the riches of this world are nothing to you,therefore of what use is the knowledge of this treasure to you', 'Alone and on foot, you could carry away a mere handful', 'But tell mewhere it is, and I will load my eighty camels with it, and give youone of them as a token of my gratitude', '\"Certainly my offer does not sound very magnificent, but it wasgreat to me, for at his words a wave of covetousness had sweptover my heart, and I almost felt as if the seventy-nine camelsthat were left were nothing in comparison', 'The dervish saw quite well what was passing in my mind, but he didnot show what he thought of my proposal', '\"My brother,\" he answered quietly, \"you know as well as I do,that you are behaving unjustly', 'It was open to me to keep my secret,and to reserve the treasure for myself', 'But the fact that I havetold you of its existence shows that I had confidence in you,and that I hoped to earn your gratitude for ever, by making yourfortune as well as mine', 'But before I reveal to you the secretof the treasure, you must swear that, after we have loaded thecamels with as much as they can carry, you will give half to me,and let us go our own ways', 'I think you will see that this is fair,for if you present me with forty camels, I on my side will give youthe means of buying a thousand more', '\"I could not of course deny that what the dervish said was perfectlyreasonable, but, in spite of that, the thought that the dervishwould be as rich as I was unbearable to me', 'Still there was nouse in discussing the matter, and I had to accept his conditionsor bewail to the end of my life the loss of immense wealth', 'So I collected my camels and we set out together under the guidanceof the dervish', 'After walking some time, we reached what lookedlike a valley, but with such a narrow entrance that my camels couldonly pass one by one', 'The little valley, or open space, was shutup by two mountains, whose sides were formed of straight cliffs,which no human being could climb', 'When we were exactly between these mountains the dervish stopped', '\"Make your camels lie down in this open space,\" he said, \"so that wecan easily load them; then we will go to the treasure', '\"I did what I was bid, and rejoined the dervish, whom I found tryingto kindle a fire out of some dry wood', 'As soon as it was alight,he threw on it a handful of perfumes, and pronounced a few wordsthat I did not understand, and immediately a thick column of smokerose high into the air', 'He separated the smoke into two columns,and then I saw a rock, which stood like a pillar between thetwo mountains, slowly open, and a splendid palace appear within', 'But, Commander of the Faithful, the love of gold had taken suchpossession of my heart, that I could not even stop to examinethe riches, but fell upon the first pile of gold within my reachand began to heap it into a sack that I had brought with me', 'The dervish likewise set to work, but I soon noticed that heconfined himself to collecting precious stones, and I felt Ishould be wise to follow his example', 'At length the camelswere loaded with as much as they could carry, and nothingremained but to seal up the treasure, and go our ways', 'Before, however, this was done, the dervish went up to a greatgolden vase, beautifully chased, and took from it a small wooden box,which he hid in the bosom of his dress, merely saying that itcontained a special kind of ointment', 'Then he once more kindledthe fire, threw on the perfume, and murmured the unknown spell,and the rock closed, and stood whole as before', 'The next thing was to divide the camels, and to charge them withthe treasure, after which we each took command of our own and marchedout of the valley, till we reached the place in the high roadwhere the routes diverge, and then we parted, the dervish goingtowards Balsora, and I to Bagdad', 'We embraced each other tenderly,and I poured out my gratitude for the honour he had done me,in singling me out for this great wealth, and having said a heartyfarewell we turned our backs, and hastened after our camels', 'I had hardly come up with mine when the demon of envy filled my soul', '\"What does a dervish want with riches like that', '\"  I said to myself', '\"He alone has the secret of the treasure, and can always get as muchas he wants,\" and I halted my camels by the roadside, and ran backafter him', 'I was a quick runner, and it did not take me very long to come upwith him', '\"My brother,\" I exclaimed, as soon as I could speak,\"almost at the moment of our leave-taking, a reflection occurredto me, which is perhaps new to you', 'You are a dervish by profession,and live a very quiet life, only caring to do good, and carelessof the things of this world', 'You do not realise the burden that youlay upon yourself, when you gather into your hands such great wealth,besides the fact that no one, who is not accustomed to camels fromhis birth, can ever manage the stubborn beasts', 'If you are wise,you will not encumber yourself with more than thirty, and you will findthose trouble enough', '\"\"You are right,\" replied the dervish, who understood me quite well,but did not wish to fight the matter', '\"I confess I had not thoughtabout it', 'Choose any ten you like, and drive them before you', '\"I selected ten of the best camels, and we proceeded along the road,to rejoin those I had left behind', 'I had got what I wanted, but Ihad found the dervish so easy to deal with, that I rather regrettedI had not asked for ten more', 'I looked back', 'He had only gonea few paces, and I called after him', '\"My brother,\" I said, \"I am unwilling to part from you withoutpointing out what I think you scarcely grasp, that large experienceof camel-driving is necessary to anybody who intends to keeptogether a troop of thirty', 'In your own interest, I feel sure youwould be much happier if you entrusted ten more of them to me,for with my practice it is all one to me if I take two or a hundred', '\"As before, the dervish made no difficulties, and I drove off my tencamels in triumph, only leaving him with twenty for his share', 'I had now sixty, and anyone might have imagined that I shouldbe content', 'But, Commander of the Faithful, there is a proverb that says,\"the more one has, the more one wants', '\"  So it was with me', 'I could not rest as long as one solitary camel remained to the dervish;and returning to him I redoubled my prayers and embraces, and promisesof eternal gratitude, till the last twenty were in my hands', '\"Make a good use of them, my brother,\" said the holy man', '\"Remember riches sometimes have wings if we keep them for ourselves,and the poor are at our gates expressly that we may help them', '\"My eyes were so blinded by gold, that I paid no heed to his wise counsel,and only looked about for something else to grasp', 'Suddenly Iremembered the little box of ointment that the dervish had hidden,and which most likely contained a treasure more precious than allthe rest', 'Giving him one last embrace, I observed accidentally,\"What are you going to do with that little box of ointment', 'It seemshardly worth taking with you; you might as well let me have it', 'And really, a dervish who has given up the world has no needof ointment', '\"Oh, if he had only refused my request', 'But then, supposing he had,I should have got possession of it by force, so great was themadness that had laid hold upon me', 'However, far from refusing it,the dervish at once held it out, saying gracefully, \"Take it,my friend, and if there is anything else I can do to make you happyyou must let me know', '\"Directly the box was in my hands I wrenched off the cover', '\"As you are so kind,\" I said, \"tell me, I pray you, what are thevirtues of this ointment', '\"\"They are most curious and interesting,\" replied the dervish', '\"If you apply a little of it to your left eye you will beholdin an instant all the treasures hidden in the bowels of the earth', 'But beware lest you touch your right eye with it, or your sight willbe destroyed for ever', '\"His words excited my curiosity to the highest pitch', '\"Make trialon me, I implore you,\" I cried, holding out the box to the dervish', '\"You will know how to do it better than I', 'I am burning withimpatience to test its charms', '\"The dervish took the box I had extended to him, and, bidding meshut my left eye, touched it gently with the ointment', 'When Iopened it again I saw spread out, as it were before me, treasures ofevery kind and without number', 'But as all this time I had beenobliged to keep my right eye closed, which was very fatiguing,I begged the dervish to apply the ointment to that eye also', '\"If you insist upon it I will do it,\" answered the dervish,\"but you must remember what I told you just now--that if it touchesyour right eye you will become blind on the spot', '\"Unluckily, in spite of my having proved the truth of the dervish\\'s wordsin so many instances, I was firmly convinced that he was now keepingconcealed from me some hidden and precious virtue of the ointment', 'So I turned a deaf ear to all he said', '\"My brother,\" I replied smiling, \"I see you are joking', 'It isnot natural that the same ointment should have two such exactlyopposite effects', '\"\"It is true all the same,\" answered the dervish, \"and it wouldbe well for you if you believed my word', '\"But I would not believe, and, dazzled by the greed of avarice,I thought that if one eye could show me riches, the other mightteach me how to get possession of them', 'And I continued to pressthe dervish to anoint my right eye, but this he resolutely declinedto do', '\"After having conferred such benefits on you,\" said he, \"I amloth indeed to work you such evil', 'Think what it is to be blind,and do not force me to do what you will repent as long as you live', '\"It was of no use', '\"My brother,\" I said firmly, \"pray say no more,but do what I ask', 'You have most generously responded to my wishesup to this time, da not spoil my recollection of you for a thingof such little consequence', 'Let what will happen I take it on myown head, and will never reproach you', '\"\"Since you are determined upon it,\" he answered with a sigh,\"there is no use talking,\" and taking the ointment he laid someon my right eye, which was tight shut', 'When I tried to open itheavy clouds of darkness floated before me', 'I was as blind as yousee me now', '\"Miserable dervish', '\"  I shrieked, \"so it is true after all', 'Into what a bottomless pit has my lust after gold plunged me', 'Ah, now that my eyes are closed they are really opened', 'I know thatall my sufferings are caused by myself alone', 'But, good brother,you, who are so kind and charitable, and know the secrets of suchvast learning, have you nothing that will give me back my sight', '\"\"Unhappy man,\" replied the dervish, \"it is not my fault that this hasbefallen you, but it is a just chastisement', 'The blindness of yourheart has wrought the blindness of your body', 'Yes, I have secrets;that you have seen in the short time that we have known each other', 'But I have none that will give you back your sight', 'You have provedyourself unworthy of the riches that were given you', 'Now they havepassed into my hands, whence they will flow into the hands of othersless greedy and ungrateful than you', '\"The dervish said no more and left me, speechless with shameand confusion, and so wretched that I stood rooted to the spot,while he collected the eighty camels and proceeded on his wayto Balsora', 'It was in vain that I entreated him not to leave me,but at least to take me within reach of the first passing caravan', 'He was deaf to my prayers and cries, and I should soon have been deadof hunger and misery if some merchants had not come along the trackthe following day and kindly brought me back to Bagdad', 'From a rich man I had in one moment become a beggar; and up to thistime I have lived solely on the alms that have been bestowed on me', 'But, in order to expiate the sin of avarice, which was my undoing,I oblige each passer-by to give me a blow', 'This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story', 'When the blind man had ended the Caliph addressed him: \"Baba-Abdalla, truly your sin is great, but you have suffered enough', 'Henceforth repent in private, for I will see that enough moneyis given you day by day for all your wants', '\"At these words Baba-Abdalla flung himself at the Caliph\\'s feet,and prayed that honour and happiness might be his portion for ever', 'The Story of Sidi-NoumanThe Caliph, Haroun-al-Raschid, was much pleased with the tale ofthe blind man and the dervish, and when it was finished he turnedto the young man who had ill-treated his horse, and inquiredhis name also', 'The young man replied that he was called Sidi-Nouman', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" observed the Caliph, \"I have seen horses broken all mylife long, and have even broken them myself, but I have never seenany horse broken in such a barbarous manner as by you yesterday', 'Every one who looked on was indignant, and blamed you loudly', 'As for myself, I was so angry that I was very nearly disclosingwho I was, and putting a stop to it at once', 'Still, you have notthe air of a cruel man, and I would gladly believe that you did notact in this way without some reason', 'As I am told that it was notthe first time, and indeed that every day you are to be seen floggingand spurring your horse, I wish to come to the bottom of the matter', 'But tell me the whole truth, and conceal nothing', '\"Sidi-Nouman changed colour as he heard these words, and his mannergrew confused; but he saw plainly that there was no help for it', 'So he prostrated himself before the throne of the Caliph and triedto obey, but the words stuck in his throat, and he remained silent', \"The Caliph, accustomed though he was to instant obedience,guessed something of what was passing in the young man's mind,and sought to put him at his ease\", '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" he said,\"do not think of me as the Caliph, but merely as a friend who wouldlike to hear your story', 'If there is anything in it that you areafraid may offend me, take courage, for I pardon you beforehand', 'Speak then openly and without fear, as to one who knows and loves you', '\"Reassured by the kindness of the Caliph, Sidi-Nouman at lengthbegan his tale', '\"Commander of the Faithful,\" said he, \"dazzled though I amby the lustre of your Highness\\' presence, I will do my bestto satisfy your wishes', 'I am by no means perfect, but I am notnaturally cruel, neither do I take pleasure in breaking the law', 'I admit that the treatment of my horse is calculated to give yourHighness a bad opinion of me, and to set an evil example to others;yet I have not chastised it without reason, and I have hopesthat I shall be judged more worthy of pity than punishment', '\"Commander of the Faithful, I will not trouble to describe my birth;it is not of sufficient distinction to deserve your Highness\\'attention', 'My ancestors were careful people, and I inheritedenough money to enable me to live comfortably, though without show', 'Having therefore a modest fortune, the only thing wanting to myhappiness was a wife who could return my affection, but this blessingI was not destined to get; for on the very day after my marriage,my bride began to try my patience in every way that was most hardto bear', 'Now, seeing that the customs of our land oblige us to marry withoutever beholding the person with whom we are to pass our lives,a man has of course no right to complain as long as his wifeis not absolutely repulsive, or is not positively deformed', 'And whatever defects her body may have, pleasant ways and goodbehaviour will go far to remedy them', 'The first time I saw my wife unveiled, when she had been broughtto my house with the usual ceremonies, I was enchanted to findthat I had not been deceived in regard to the account that had beengiven me of her beauty', 'I began my married life in high spirits,and the best hopes of happiness', 'The following day a grand dinner was served to us but as my wife didnot appear, I ordered a servant to call her', 'Still she did not come,and I waited impatiently for some time', 'At last she entered the room,and she took our places at the table, and plates of rice were setbefore us', 'I ate mine, as was natural, with a spoon, but great was my surpriseto notice that my wife, instead of doing the same, drew from herpocket a little case, from which she selected a long pin, and bythe help of this pin conveyed her rice grain by grain to her mouth', '\"Amina,\" I exclaimed in astonishment, \"is that the way you eat riceat home', 'And did you do it because your appetite was so small,or did you wish to count the grains so that you might never eatmore than a certain number', 'If it was from economy, and you areanxious to teach me not to be wasteful, you have no cause for alarm', 'We shall never ruin ourselves in that way', 'Our fortune is largeenough for all our needs, therefore, dear Amina, do not seek tocheck yourself, but eat as much as you desire, as I do', '\"In reply to my affectionate words, I expected a cheerful answer;yet Amina said nothing at all, but continued to pick her riceas before, only at longer and longer intervals', 'And, instead oftrying the other dishes, all she did was to put every now and thena crumb, of bread into her mouth, that would not have made a mealfor a sparrow', 'I felt provoked by her obstinacy, but to excuse her to myselfas far as I could, I suggested that perhaps she had never beenused to eat in the company of men, and that her family might havetaught her that she ought to behave prudently and discreetlyin the presence of her husband', 'Likewise that she might eitherhave dined already or intend to do so in her own apartments', 'So I took no further notice, and when I had finished left the room,secretly much vexed at her strange conduct', 'The same thing occurred at supper, and all through the next day,whenever we ate together', 'It was quite clear that no woman couldlive upon two or three bread-crumbs and a few grains of rice,and I determined to find out how and when she got food', 'I pretendednot to pay attention to anything she did, in the hope that littleby little she would get accustomed to me, and become more friendly;but I soon saw that my expectations were quite vain', 'One night I was lying with my eyes closed, and to, all appearancesound asleep, when Amina arose softly, and dressed herself withoutmaking the slightest sound', 'I could not imagine what she was goingto do, and as my curiosity was great I made up my mind to follow her', 'When she was fully dressed, she stole quietly from the room', 'The instant she had let the curtain fall behind her, I flunga garment on my shoulders and a pair of slippers on my feet', 'Looking from a lattice which opened into the court, I saw her inthe act of passing through the street door, which she carefullyleft open', 'It was bright moonlight, so I easily managed to keep her in sight,till she entered a cemetery not far from the house', 'There I hidmyself under the shadow of the wall, and crouched down cautiously;and hardly was I concealed, when I saw my wife approaching in companywith a ghoul--one of those demons which, as your Highness is aware,wander about the country making their lairs in deserted buildingsand springing out upon unwary travellers whose flesh they eat', 'If no live being goes their way, they then betake themselves tothe cemeteries, and feed upon the dead bodies', 'I was nearly struck dumb with horror on seeing my wife with thishideous female ghoul', 'They passed by me without noticing me,began to dig up a corpse which had been buried that day, and thensat down on the edge of the grave, to enjoy their frightful repast,talking quietly and cheerfully all the while, though I was too faroff to hear what they said', 'When they had finished, they threwback the body into the grave, and heaped back the earth upon it', 'I made no effort to disturb them, and returned quickly to the house,when I took care to leave the door open, as I had previously found it', 'Then I got back into bed, and pretended to sleep soundly', 'A short time after Amina entered as quietly as she had gone out', 'She undressed and stole into bed, congratulating herself apparentlyon the cleverness with which she had managed her expedition', 'As may be guessed, after such a scene it was long before I couldclose my eyes, and at the first sound which called the faithfulto prayer, I put on my clothes and went to the mosque', 'But evenprayer did not restore peace to my troubled spirit, and I couldnot face my wife until I had made up my mind what future courseI should pursue in regard to her', 'I therefore spent the morningroaming about from one garden to another, turning over variousplans for compelling my wife to give up her horrible ways;I thought of using violence to make her submit, but felt reluctantto be unkind to her', 'Besides, I had an instinct that gentlemeans had the best chance of success; so, a little soothed,I turned towards home, which I reached about the hour of dinner', 'As soon as I appeared, Amina ordered dinner to be served, and wesat down together', 'As usual, she persisted in only picking a fewgrains of rice, and I resolved to speak to her at once of what layso heavily on my heart', '\"Amina,\" I said, as quietly as possible, \"you must have guessedthe surprise I felt, when the day after our marriage you declinedto eat anything but a few morsels of rice, and altogether behavedin such a manner that most husbands would have been deeply wounded', 'However I had patience with you, and only tried to tempt your appetiteby the choicest dishes I could invent, but all to no purpose', 'Still, Amina, it seems to me that there be some among them as sweetto the taste as the flesh of a corpse', '\"I had no sooner uttered these words than Amina, who instantlyunderstood that I had followed her to the grave-yard, was seizedwith a passion beyond any that I have ever witnessed', 'Her facebecame purple, her eyes looked as if they would start from her head,and she positively foamed with rage', 'I watched her with terror, wondering what would happen next,but little thinking what would be the end of her fury', 'She seizeda vessel of water that stood at hand, and plunging her hand in it,murmured some words I failed to catch', 'Then, sprinkling it on my face,she cried madly:\"Wretch, receive the reward of your prying, and become a dog', '\"The words were not out of her mouth when, without feeling consciousthat any change was passing over me, I suddenly knew that I had ceasedto be a man', 'In the greatness of the shock and surprise--for I hadno idea that Amina was a magician--I never dreamed of running away,and stood rooted to the spot, while Amina grasped a stick and beganto beat me', 'Indeed her blows were so heavy, that I only wonder theydid not kill me at once', 'However they succeeded in rousing me frommy stupor, and I dashed into the court-yard, followed closely by Amina,who made frantic dives at me, which I was not quick enough to dodge', 'At last she got tired of pursuing me, or else a new trick enteredinto her head, which would give me speedy and painful death;she opened the gate leading into the street, intending to crush meas I passed through', 'Dog though I was, I saw through her design,and stung into presence of mind by the greatness of the danger,I timed my movements so well that I contrived to rush through,and only the tip of my tail received a squeeze as she bangedthe gate', 'I was safe, but my tail hurt me horribly, and I yelped and howled soloud all along the streets, that the other dogs came and attacked me,which made matters no better', \"In order to avoid them, I tookrefuge in a cookshop, where tongues and sheep's heads were sold\", 'At first the owner showed me great kindness, and drove awaythe other dogs that were still at my heels, while I crept intothe darkest corner', 'But though I was safe for the moment,I was not destined to remain long under his protection, for hewas one of those who hold all dogs to be unclean, and that all thewashing in the world will hardly purify you from their contact', 'So after my enemies had gone to seek other prey, he tried tolure me from my corner in order to force me into the street', 'But I refused to come out of my hole, and spent the night in sleep,which I sorely needed, after the pain inflicted on me by Amina', \"I have no wish to weary your Highness by dwelling on the sad thoughtswhich accompanied my change of shape, but it may interest you to hearthat the next morning my host went out early to do his marketing,and returned laden with the sheep's heads, and tongues and trottersthat formed his stock in trade for the day\", 'The smell of meatattracted various hungry dogs in the neighbourhood, and they gatheredround the door begging for some bits', 'I stole out of my corner,and stood with them', 'In spite of his objection to dogs, as unclean animals, my protectorwas a kind-hearted man, and knowing I had eaten nothing since yesterday,he threw me bigger and better bits than those which fell to theshare of the other dogs', 'When I had finished, I tried to go backinto the shop, but this he would not allow, and stood so firmly atthe entrance with a stout stick, that I was forced to give it up,and seek some other home', \"A few paces further on was a baker's shop, which seemed to havea gay and merry man for a master\", 'At that moment he was havinghis breakfast, and though I gave no signs of hunger, he at oncethrew me a piece of bread', 'Before gobbling it up, as most dogsare in the habit of doing, I bowed my head and wagged my tail,in token of thanks, and he understood, and smiled pleasantly', 'I really did not want the bread at all, but felt it would beungracious to refuse, so I ate it slowly, in order that he might seethat I only did it out of politeness', 'He understood this also,and seemed quite willing to let me stay in his shop, so I sat down,with my face to the door, to show that I only asked his protection', \"This he gave me, and indeed encouraged me to come into thehouse itself, giving me a corner where I might sleep, without beingin anybody's way\", 'The kindness heaped on me by this excellent man was far greaterthan I could ever have expected', 'He was always affectionatein his manner of treating me, and I shared his breakfast,dinner and supper, while, on my side, I gave him all the gratitudeand attachment to which he had a right', 'I sat with my eyes fixed on him, and he never left the housewithout having me at his heels; and if it ever happened that whenhe was preparing to go out I was asleep, and did not notice,he would call \"Rufus, Rufus,\" for that was the name he gave me', 'Some weeks passed in this way, when one day a woman came in to buy bread', 'In paying for it, she laid down several pieces of money, one ofwhich was bad', 'The baker perceived this, and declined to take it,demanding another in its place', 'The woman, for her part, refused totake it back, declaring it was perfectly good, but the baker wouldhave nothing to do with it', '\"It is really such a bad imitation,\"he exclaimed at last, \"that even my dog would not be taken in', 'Here Rufus', 'Rufus', '\" and hearing his voice, I jumped on to the counter', 'The baker threw down the money before me, and said, \"Find outif there is a bad coin', '\"  I looked at each in turn, and then laidmy paw on the false one, glancing at the same time at my master,so as to point it out', 'The baker, who had of course been only in joke, was exceedinglysurprised at my cleverness, and the woman, who was at last convincedthat the man spoke the truth, produced another piece of moneyin its place', 'When she had gone, my master was so pleased that hetold all the neighbours what I had done, and made a great dealmore of it than there really was', 'The neighbours, very naturally, declined to believe his story,and tried me several times with all the bad money they couldcollect together, but I never failed to stand the test triumphantly', 'Soon, the shop was filled from morning till night, with peoplewho on the pretence of buying bread came to see if I was as cleveras I was reported to be', 'The baker drove a roaring trade,and admitted that I was worth my weight in gold to him', 'Of course there were plenty who envied him his large custom,and many was the pitfall set for me, so that he never dared to letme out of his sight', 'One day a woman, who had not been in theshop before, came to ask for bread, like the rest', 'As usual,I was lying on the counter, and she threw down six coins before me,one of which was false', 'I detected it at once, and put my paw on it,looking as I did so at the woman', '\"Yes,\" she said, nodding her head', '\"You are quite right, that is the one', '\"  She stood gazing at meattentively for some time, then paid for the bread, and left the shop,making a sign for me to follow her secretly', 'Now my thoughts were always running on some means of shaking offthe spell laid on me, and noticing the way in which this womanhad looked at me, the idea entered my head that perhaps she mighthave guessed what had happened, and in this I was not deceived', 'However I let her go on a little way, and merely stood at the doorwatching her', 'She turned, and seeing that I was quite still,she again beckoned to me', 'The baker all this while was busy with his oven, and had forgottenall about me, so I stole out softly, and ran after the woman', 'When we came to her house, which was some distance off, she openedthe door and then said to me, \"Come in, come in; you will never besorry that you followed me', '\"  When I had entered she fastened the door,and took me into a large room, where a beautiful girl was workingat a piece of embroidery', '\"My daughter,\" exclaimed my guide,\"I have brought you the famous dog belonging to the baker which cantell good money from bad', 'You know that when I first heard of him,I told you I was sure he must be really a man, changed into a dogby magic', \"To-day I went to the baker's, to prove for myselfthe truth of the story, and persuaded the dog to follow me here\", 'Now what do you say', '\"\"You are right, mother,\" replied the girl, and rising she dipped herhand into a vessel of water', 'Then sprinkling it over me she said,\"If you were born dog, remain dog; but if you were born man,by virtue of this water resume your proper form', '\"  In one moment thespell was broken', \"The dog's shape vanished as if it had never been,and it was a man who stood before her\", 'Overcome with gratitude at my deliverance, I flung myself ather feet, and kissed the hem of her garment', '\"How can I thank youfor your goodness towards a stranger, and for what you have done', 'Henceforth I am your slave', 'Deal with me as you will', '\"Then, in order to explain how I came to be changed into a dog,I told her my whole story, and finished with rendering the motherthe thanks due to her for the happiness she had brought me', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" returned the daughter, \"say no more about theobligation you are under to us', 'The knowledge that we have beenof service to you is ample payment', 'Let us speak of Amina, your wife,with whom I was acquainted before her marriage', 'I was aware that shewas a magician, and she knew too that I had studied the same art,under the same mistress', 'We met often going to the same baths,but we did not like each other, and never sought to become friends', 'As to what concerns you, it is not enough to have broken your spell,she must be punished for her wickedness', 'Remain for a moment withmy mother, I beg,\" she added hastily, \"I will return shortly', '\"Left alone with the mother, I again expressed the gratitude I felt,to her as well as to her daughter', '\"My daughter,\" she answered, \"is, as you see, as accomplished a magicianas Amina herself, but you would be astonished at the amount of goodshe does by her knowledge', 'That is why I have never interfered,otherwise I should have put a stop to it long ago', '\"  As she spoke,her daughter entered with a small bottle in her hand', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" she said, \"the books I have just consulted tellme that Amina is not home at present, but she should return atany moment', 'I have likewise found out by their means, that shepretends before the servants great uneasiness as to your absence', 'She has circulated a story that, while at dinner with her,you remembered some important business that had to be done at once,and left the house without shutting the door', 'By this means a doghad strayed in, which she was forced to get rid of by a stick', \"Go home then without delay, and await Amina's return in your room\", 'When she comes in, go down to meet her, and in her surprise, she willtry to run away', 'Then have this bottle ready, and dash the water itcontains over her, saying boldly, \"Receive the reward of your crimes', '\" That is all I have to tell you', '\"Everything happened exactly as the young magician had foretold', 'I had not been in my house many minutes before Amina returned, and asshe approached I stepped in front of her, with the water in my hand', 'She gave one loud cry, and turned to the door, but she was too late', 'I had already dashed the water in her face and spoken the magic words', 'Amina disappeared, and in her place stood the horse you saw mebeating yesterday', 'This, Commander of the Faithful, is my story, and may I ventureto hope that, now you have heard the reason of my conduct,your Highness will not think this wicked woman too harshly treated', '\"Sidi-Nouman,\" replied the Caliph, \"your story is indeed a strange one,and there is no excuse to be offered for your wife', 'But, withoutcondemning your treatment of her, I wish you to reflect how muchshe must suffer from being changed into an animal, and I hope youwill let that punishment be enough', 'I do not order you to insistupon the young magician finding the means to restore your wife to herhuman shape, because I know that when once women such as she beginto work evil they never leave off, and I should only bring down onyour head a vengeance far worse than the one you have undergone already', '\"Story of Ali Colia, Merchant of BagdadIn the reign of Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived in Bagdad amerchant named Ali Cogia, who, having neither wife nor child,contented himself with the modest profits produced by his trade', 'He had spent some years quite happily in the house his father hadleft him, when three nights running he dreamed that an old man hadappeared to him, and reproached him for having neglected the dutyof a good Mussulman, in delaying so long his pilgrimage to Mecca', 'Ali Cogia was much troubled by this dream, as he was unwillingto give up his shop, and lose all his customers', 'He had shut hiseyes for some time to the necessity of performing this pilgrimage,and tried to atone to his conscience by an extra number of good works,but the dream seemed to him a direct warning, and he resolved to putthe journey off no longer', 'The first thing he did was to sell his furniture and the wareshe had in his shop, only reserving to himself such goods as hemight trade with on the road', 'The shop it-self he sold also,and easily found a tenant for his private house', 'The only matter hecould not settle satisfactorily was the safe custody of a thousandpieces of gold which he wished to leave behind him', 'After some thought, Ali Cogia hit upon a plan which seemed a safe one', 'He took a large vase, and placing the money in the bottom of it,filled up the rest with olives', 'After corking the vase tightly down,he carried it to one of his friends, a merchant like himself,and said to him:\"My brother, you have probably heard that I am staffing with a caravanin a few days for Mecca', 'I have come to ask whether you woulddo me the favour to keep this vase of olives for me till I come back', '\"The merchant replied readily, \"Look, this is the key of my shop: take it, and put the vase wherever you like', 'I promise that you shallfind it in the same place on your return', '\"A few days later, Ali Cogia mounted the camel that he had ladenwith merchandise, joined the caravan, and arrived in due timeat Mecca', 'Like the other pilgrims he visited the sacred Mosque,and after all his religious duties were performed, he set out hisgoods to the best advantage, hoping to gain some customers amongthe passers-by', 'Very soon two merchants stopped before the pile, and when theyhad turned it over, one said to the other:\"If this man was wise he would take these things to Cairo, where hewould get a much better price than he is likely to do here', '\"Ali Cogia heard the words, and lost no time in following the advice', 'He packed up his wares, and instead of returning to Bagdad,joined a caravan that was going to Cairo', 'The results of the journeygladdened his heart', 'He sold off everything almost directly,and bought a stock of Egyptian curiosities, which he intended sellingat Damascus; but as the caravan with which he would have to travelwould not be starting for another six weeks, he took advantageof the delay to visit the Pyramids, and some of the cities alongthe banks of the Nile', 'Now the attractions of Damascus so fascinated the worthy Ali,that he could hardly tear himself away, but at length he rememberedthat he had a home in Bagdad, meaning to return by way of Aleppo,and after he had crossed the Euphrates, to follow the course ofthe Tigris', 'But when he reached Mossoul, Ali had made such friends with somePersian merchants, that they persuaded him to accompany themto their native land, and even as far as India, and so it cameto pass that seven years had slipped by since he had left Bagdad,and during all that time the friend with whom he had left the vaseof olives had never once thought of him or of it', \"In fact,it was only a month before Ali Cogia's actual return that the affaircame into his head at all, owing to his wife's remarking one day,that it was a long time since she had eaten any olives, and wouldlike some\", '\"That reminds me,\" said the husband, \"that before Ali Cogia wentto Mecca seven years ago, he left a vase of olives in my care', 'But really by this time he must be dead, and there is no reason weshould not eat the olives if we like', 'Give me a light, and I willfetch them and see how they taste', '\"\"My husband,\" answered the wife, \"beware, I pray, of your doinganything so base', 'Supposing seven years have passed without newsof Ali Cogia, he need not be dead for all that, and may come backany day', 'How shameful it would be to have to confess that youhad betrayed your trust and broken the seal of the vase', 'Pay noattention to my idle words, I really have no desire for olives now', 'And probably after all this while they are no longer good', 'I have a presentiment that Ali Cogia will return, and what will hethink of you', 'Give it up, I entreat', '\"The merchant, however, refused to listen to her advice, sensiblethough it was', 'He took a light and a dish and went into his shop', '\"If you will be so obstinate,\" said his wife, \"I cannot help it;but do not blame me if it turns out ill', '\"When the merchant opened the vase he found the topmost oliveswere rotten, and in order to see if the under ones were in bettercondition he shook some out into the dish', 'As they fell out a fewof the gold pieces fell out too', \"The sight of the money roused all the merchant's greed\", 'He lookedinto the vase, and saw that all the bottom was filled with gold', 'He then replaced the olives and returned to his wife', '\"My wife,\" he said, as he entered the room, \"you were quite right;the olives are rotten, and I have recorked the vase so well that AliCogia will never know it has been touched', '\"\"You would have done better to believe me,\" replied the wife', '\"I trust that no harm will come of it', '\"These words made no more impression on the merchant than the othershad done; and he spent the whole night in wondering how he could manageto keep the gold if Ali Cogia should come back and claim his vase', 'Very early next morning he went out and bought fresh new olives;he then threw away the old ones, took out the gold and hid it,and filled up the vase with the olives he had bought', 'This done herecorked the vase and put it in the same place where it had been leftby Ali Cogia', 'A month later Ali Cogia re-entered Bagdad, and as his house wasstill let he went to an inn; and the following day set out to seehis friend the merchant, who received him with open arms and manyexpressions of surprise', 'After a few moments given to inquiriesAli Cogia begged the merchant to hand him over the vase that hehad taken care of for so long', '\"Oh certainly,\" said he, \"I am only glad I could be of use to youin the matter', 'Here is the key of my shop; you will find the vasein the place where you put it', '\"Ali Cogia fetched his vase and carried it to his room at the inn,where he opened it', 'He thrust down his hand but could feel no money,but still was persuaded it must be there', 'So he got some platesand vessels from his travelling kit and emptied out the olives', 'To no purpose', 'The gold was not there', 'The poor man was dumbwith horror, then, lifting up his hands, he exclaimed, \"Can my oldfriend really have committed such a crime', '\"In great haste he went back to the house of the merchant', '\"My friend,\"he cried, \"you will be astonished to see me again, but I can findnowhere in this vase a thousand pieces of gold that I placed in thebottom under the olives', 'Perhaps you may have taken a loan of themfor your business purposes; if that is so you are most welcome', 'I will only ask you to give me a receipt, and you can pay the moneyat your leisure', '\"The merchant, who had expected something of the sort, had his replyall ready', '\"Ali Cogia,\" he said, \"when you brought me the vaseof olives did I ever touch it', '\"\"I gave you the key of my shop and you put it yourself where you liked,and did you not find it in exactly the same spot and in thesame state', 'If you placed any gold in it, it must be there still', 'I know nothing about that; you only told me there were olives', 'You can believe me or not, but I have not laid a finger on the vase', '\"Ali Cogia still tried every means to persuade the merchant to admitthe truth', '\"I love peace,\" he said, \"and shall deeply regret havingto resort to harsh measures', 'Once more, think of your reputation', 'I shall be in despair if you oblige me to call in the aid of the law', '\"\"Ali Cogia,\" answered the merchant, \"you allow that it was a vaseof olives you placed in my charge', 'You fetched it and removedit yourself, and now you tell me it contained a thousand piecesof gold, and that I must restore them to you', 'Did you ever sayanything about them before', 'Why, I did not even know that thevase had olives in it', 'Yon never showed them to me', 'I wonderyou have not demanded pearls or diamonds', 'Retire, I pray you,lest a crowd should gather in front of my shop', '\"By this time not only the casual passers-by, but also theneighbouring merchants, were standing round, listening to the dispute,and trying every now and then to smooth matters between them', \"But at the merchant's last words Ali Cogia resolved to lay thecause of the quarrel before them, and told them the whole story\", 'They heard him to the end, and inquired of the merchant what hehad to say', \"The accused man admitted that he had kept Ali Cogia's vase in his shop;but he denied having touched it, and swore that as to what itcontained he only knew what Ali Cogia had told him, and calledthem all to witness the insult that had been put upon him\", '\"You have brought it on yourself,\" said Ali Cogia, taking himby the arm, \"and as you appeal to the law, the law you shall have', 'Let us see if you will dare to repeat your story before the Cadi', '\"Now as a good Mussulman the merchant was forbidden to refuse thischoice of a judge, so he accepted the test, and said to Ali Cogia,\"Very well; I should like nothing better', 'We shall soon see whichof us is in the right', '\"So the two men presented themselves before the Cadi, and Ali Cogiaagain repeated his tale', 'The Cadi asked what witnesses he had', 'Ali Cogia replied that he had not taken this precaution, as he hadconsidered the man his friend, and up to that time had always foundhim honest', 'The merchant, on his side, stuck to his story, and offered to swearsolemnly that not only had he never stolen the thousand gold pieces,but that he did not even know they were there', 'The Cadi allowed himto take the oath, and pronounced him innocent', 'Ali Cogia, furious at having to suffer such a loss, protested againstthe verdict, declaring that he would appeal to the Caliph,Haroun-al-Raschid, himself', 'But the Cadi paid no attentionto his threats, and was quite satisfied that he had done what was right', 'Judgment being given the merchant returned home triumphant, and AliCogia went back to his inn to draw up a petition to the Caliph', 'The next morning he placed himself on the road along which the Caliphmust pass after mid-day prayer, and stretched out his petition to theofficer who walked before the Caliph, whose duty it was to collectsuch things, and on entering the palace to hand them to his master', 'There Haroun-al-Raschid studied them carefully', 'Knowing this custom, Ali Cogia followed the Caliph into the publichall of the palace, and waited the result', 'After some time theofficer appeared, and told him that the Caliph had read his petition,and had appointed an hour the next morning to give him audience', \"He then inquired the merchant's address, so that he might be summonedto attend also\", 'That very evening, the Caliph, with his grand-vizir Giafar, and Mesrour,chief of the eunuchs, all three disguised, as was their habit,went out to take a stroll through the town', \"Going down one street, the Caliph's attention was attractedby a noise, and looking through a door which opened into a courthe perceived ten or twelve children playing in the moonlight\", 'He hid himself in a dark corner, and watched them', '\"Let us play at being the Cadi,\" said the brightest and quickestof them all; \"I will be the Cadi', 'Bring before me Ali Cogia,and the merchant who robbed him of the thousand pieces of gold', '\"The boy\\'s words recalled to the Caliph the petition he had readthat morning, and he waited with interest to see what the childrenwould do', 'The proposal was hailed with joy by the other children, who had hearda great deal of talk about the matter, and they quickly settledthe part each one was to play', 'The Cadi took his seat gravely,and an officer introduced first Ali Cogia, the plaintiff, and thenthe merchant who was the defendant', 'Ali Cogia made a low bow, and pleaded his cause point by point;concluding by imploring the Cadi not to inflict on him such aheavy loss', 'The Cadi having heard his case, turned to the merchant, and inquiredwhy he had not repaid Ali Cogia the sum in question', 'The false merchant repeated the reasons that the real merchanthad given to the Cadi of Bagdad, and also offered to swear that hehad told the truth', '\"Stop a moment', '\" said the little Cadi, \"before we come to oaths,I should like to examine the vase with the olives', 'Ali Cogia,\"he added, \"have you got the vase with you', '\" and finding he had not,the Cadi continued, \"Go and get it, and bring it to me', '\"So Ali Cogia disappeared for an instant, and then pretendedto lay a vase at the feet of the Cadi, declaring it was his vase,which he had given to the accused for safe custody; and in orderto be quite correct, the Cadi asked the merchant if he recognised itas the same vase', 'By his silence the merchant admitted the fact,and the Cadi then commanded to have the vase opened', 'Ali Cogiamade a movement as if he was taking off the lid, and the littleCadi on his part made a pretence of peering into a vase', '\"What beautiful olives', '\" he said, \"I should like to taste one,\"and pretending to put one in his mouth, he added, \"they arereally excellent', '\"\"But,\" he went on, \"it seems to me odd that olives seven yearsold should be as good as that', 'Send for some dealers in olives,and let us hear what they say', '\"Two children were presented to him as olive merchants, and the Cadiaddressed them', '\"Tell me,\" he said, \"how long can olives be keptso as to be pleasant eating', '\"\"My lord,\" replied the merchants, \"however much care is takento preserve them, they never last beyond the third year', 'They loseboth taste and colour, and are only fit to be thrown away', '\"\"If that is so,\" answered the little Cadi, \"examine this vase,and tell me how long the olives have been in it', '\"The olive merchants pretended to examine the olives and taste them;then reported to the Cadi that they were fresh and good', '\"You are mistaken,\" said he, \"Ali Cogia declares he put themin that vase seven years ago', '\"\"My lord,\" returned the olive merchants, \"we can assure you thatthe olives are those of the present year', 'And if you consult allthe merchants in Bagdad you will not find one to give a contrary opinion', '\"The accused merchant opened his mouth as if to protest, but theCadi gave him no time', '\"Be silent,\" he said, \"you are a thief', 'Take him away and hang him', '\"  So the game ended, the childrenclapping their hands in applause, and leading the criminal awayto be hanged', 'Haroun-al-Raschid was lost in astonishment at the wisdom of the child,who had given so wise a verdict on the case which he himself wasto hear on the morrow', '\"Is there any other verdict possible', '\"he asked the grand-vizir, who was as much impressed as himself', '\"I can imagine no better judgment', '\"\"If the circumstances are really such as we have heard,\"replied the grand-vizir, \"it seems to me your Highness couldonly follow the example of this boy, in the method of reasoning,and also in your conclusions', '\"\"Then take careful note of this house,\" said the Caliph, \"and bring methe boy to-morrow, so that the affair may be tried by him in my presence', 'Summon also the Cadi, to learn his duty from the mouth of a child', 'Bid Ali Cogia bring his vase of olives, and see that two dealersin olives are present', '\"  So saying the Caliph returned to the palace', 'The next morning early, the grand-vizir went back to the housewhere they had seen the children playing, and asked for the mistressand her children', 'Three boys appeared, and the grand-vizir inquiredwhich had represented the Cadi in their game of the previous evening', \"The eldest and tallest, changing colour, confessed that it was he,and to his mother's great alarm, the grand-vizir said that he hadstrict orders to bring him into the presence of the Caliph\", '\"Does he want to take my son from me', '\" cried the poor woman;but the grand-vizir hastened to calm her, by assuring her that sheshould have the boy again in an hour, and she would be quitesatisfied when she knew the reason of the summons', 'So she dressedthe boy in his best clothes, and the two left the house', 'When the grand-vizir presented the child to the Caliph, he wasa little awed and confused, and the Caliph proceeded to explainwhy he had sent for him', '\"Approach, my son,\" he said kindly', '\"I think it was you who judged the case of Ali Cogia and the merchantlast night', 'I overheard you by chance, and was very pleasedwith the way you conducted it', 'To-day you will see the real AliCogia and the real merchant', 'Seat yourself at once next to me', '\"The Caliph being seated on his throne with the boy next him, the partiesto the suit were ushered in', 'One by one they prostrated themselves,and touched the carpet at the foot of the throne with their foreheads', 'When they rose up, the Caliph said:  \"Now speak', 'This child willgive you justice, and if more should be wanted I will see to it myself', '\"Ali Cogia and the merchant pleaded one after the other,but when the merchant offered to swear the same oath that hehad taken before the Cadi, he was stopped by the child, who saidthat before this was done he must first see the vase of olives', 'At these words, Ali Cogia presented the vase to the Caliph,and uncovered it', 'The Caliph took one of the olives, tasted it,and ordered the expert merchants to do the same', 'They pronouncedthe olives good, and fresh that year', 'The boy informed them that AliCogia declared it was seven years since he had placed them in the vase;to which they returned the same answer as the children had done', 'The accused merchant saw by this time that his condemnationwas certain, and tried to allege something in his defence', 'The boy had too much sense to order him to be hanged, and looked atthe Caliph, saying, \"Commander of the Faithful, this is not a game now;it is for your Highness to condemn him to death and not for me', '\"Then the Caliph, convinced that the man was a thief, bade them takehim away and hang him, which was done, but not before he had confessedhis guilt and the place in which he had hidden Ali Cogia\\'s money', 'The Caliph ordered the Cadi to learn how to deal out justice fromthe mouth of a child, and sent the boy home, with a purse containinga hundred pieces of gold as a mark of his favour', 'The Enchanted HorseIt was the Feast of the New Year, the oldest and most splendid ofall the feasts in the Kingdom of Persia, and the day had been spentby the king in the city of Schiraz, taking part in the magnificentspectacles prepared by his subjects to do honour to the festival', 'The sun was setting, and the monarch was about to give his court thesignal to retire, when suddenly an Indian appeared before his throne,leading a horse richly harnessed, and looking in every respectexactly like a real one', '\"Sire,\" said he, prostrating himself as he spoke, \"although I makemy appearance so late before your Highness, I can confidentlyassure you that none of the wonders you have seen during the daycan be compared to this horse, if you will deign to cast your eyesupon him', '\"\"I see nothing in it,\" replied the king, \"except a clever imitationof a real one; and any skilled workman might do as much', '\"\"Sire,\" returned the Indian, \"it is not of his outward form that Iwould speak, but of the use that I can make of him', 'I have onlyto mount him, and to wish myself in some special place, and nomatter how distant it may be, in a very few moments I shall findmyself there', 'It is this, Sire, that makes the horse so marvellous,and if your Highness will allow me, you can prove it for yourself', '\"The King of Persia, who was interested in every thing out of the common,and had never before come across a horse with such qualities,bade the Indian mount tho animal, and show what he could do', 'In an instant the man had vaulted on his back, and inquired wherethe monarch wished to send him', '\"Do you see that mountain', '\" asked the king, pointing to a hugemass that towered into the sky about three leagues from Schiraz;\"go and bring me the leaf of a palm that grows at the foot', '\"The words were hardly out of the king\\'s mouth when the Indianturned a screw placed in the horse\\'s neck, close to the saddle,and the animal bounded like lightning up into the air, and was soonbeyond the sight even of the sharpest eyes', 'In a quarter of anhour the Indian was seen returning, bearing in his hand the palm,and, guiding his horse to the foot of the throne, he dismounted,and laid the leaf before the king', 'Now the monarch had no sooner proved the astonishing speed of which thehorse was capable than he longed to possess it himself, and indeed,so sure was he that the Indian would be quite ready to sell it,that he looked upon it as his own already', '\"I never guessed from his mere outside how valuable an animal he was,\"he remarked to the Indian, \"and I am grateful to you for having shownme my error,\" said he', '\"If you will sell it, name your own price', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the Indian, \"I never doubted that a sovereign so wiseand accomplished as your Highness would do justice to my horse,when he once knew its power; and I even went so far as to think itprobable that you might wish to possess it', 'Greatly as I prize it,I will yield it up to your Highness on one condition', 'The horsewas not constructed by me, but it was given me by the inventor,in exchange for my only daughter, who made me take a solemn oath that Iwould never part with it, except for some object of equal value', '\"\"Name anything you like,\" cried the monarch, interrupting him', '\"My kingdom is large, and filled with fair cities', 'You have onlyto choose which you would prefer, to become its ruler to the endof your life', '\"\"Sire,\" answered the Indian, to whom the proposal did not seemnearly so generous as it appeared to the king, \"I am mostgrateful to your Highness for your princely offer, and beseechyou not to be offended with me if I say that I can only deliverup my horse in exchange for the hand of the princess your daughter', '\"A shout of laughter burst from the courtiers as they heard these words,and Prince Firouz Schah, the heir apparent, was filled with angerat the Indian\\'s presumption', 'The king, however, thought that itwould not cost him much to part from the princess in order to gainsuch a delightful toy, and while he was hesitating as to his answerthe prince broke in', '\"Sire,\" he said, \"it is not possible that you can doubt for aninstant what reply you should give to such an insolent bargain', 'Consider what you owe to yourself, and to the blood of your ancestors', '\"\"My son,\" replied the king, \"you speak nobly, but you do notrealise either the value of the horse, or the fact that if I rejectthe proposal of the Indian, he will only make the same to someother monarch, and I should be filled with despair at the thoughtthat anyone but myself should own this Seventh Wonder of the World', \"Of course I do not say that I shall accept his conditions,and perhaps he may be brought to reason, but meanwhile I shouldlike you to examine the horse, and, with the owner's permission,to make trial of its powers\", '\"The Indian, who had overheard the king\\'s speech, thought that hesaw in it signs of yielding to his proposal, so he joyfully agreedto the monarch\\'s wishes, and came forward to help the prince to mountthe horse, and show him how to guide it:  but, before he had finished,the young man turned the screw, and was soon out of sight', 'They waited some time, expecting that every moment he might be seenreturning in the distance, but at length the Indian grew frightened,and prostrating himself before the throne, he said to the king,\"Sire, your Highness must have noticed that the prince,in his impatience, did not allow me to tell him what it was necessaryto do in order to return to the place from which he started', 'I implore you not to punish me for what was not my fault, and notto visit on me any misfortune that may occur', '\"\"But why,\" cried the king in a burst of fear and anger, \"why didyou not call him back when you saw him disappearing', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the Indian, \"the rapidity of his movements took meso by surprise that he was out of hearing before I recovered my speech', 'But we must hope that he will perceive and turn a second screw,which will have the effect of bringing the horse back to earth', '\"\"But supposing he does', '\" answered the king, \"what is to hinderthe horse from descending straight into the sea, or dashing himto pieces on the rocks', '\"\"Have no fears, your Highness,\" said the Indian; \"the horse hasthe gift of passing over seas, and of carrying his rider whereverhe wishes to go', '\"\"Well, your head shall answer for it,\" returned the monarch, \"and ifin three months he is not safe back with me, or at any rate doesnot send me news of his safety, your life shall pay the penalty', '\" So saying, he ordered his guards to seize the Indian and throw himinto prison', 'Meanwhile, Prince Firouz Schah had gone gaily up into the air,and for the space of an hour continued to ascend higher and higher,till the very mountains were not distinguishable from the plains', 'Then he began to think it was time to come down, and took for grantedthat, in order to do this, it was only needful to turn the screwthe reverse way; but, to his surprise and horror, he found that,turn as he might, he did not make the smallest impression', 'He then remembered that he had never waited to ask how he was to getback to earth again, and understood the danger in which he stood', \"Luckily, he did not lose his head, and set about examining thehorse's neck with great care, till at last, to his intense joy,he discovered a tiny little peg, much smaller than the other,close to the right ear\", 'This he turned, and found him-self droppingto the earth, though more slowly than he had left it', 'It was now dark, and as the prince could see nothing, he was obliged,not without some feeling of disquiet, to allow the horse to directhis own course, and midnight was already passed before Prince FirouzSchah again touched the ground, faint and weary from his long ride,and from the fact that he had eaten nothing since early morning', 'The first thing he did on dismounting was to try to find out wherehe was, and, as far as he could discover in the thick darkness,he found himself on the terraced roof of a huge palace, with abalustrade of marble running round', 'In one corner of the terrace stooda small door, opening on to a staircase which led down into the palace', 'Some people might have hesitated before exploring further, but notso the prince', '\"I am doing no harm,\" he said, \"and whoever the ownermay be, he will not touch me when he sees I am unarmed,\" and in dreadof making a false step, he went cautiously down the staircase', 'On a landing, he noticed an open door, beyond which was a faintlylighted hall', 'Before entering, the prince paused and listened, but he heardnothing except the sound of men snoring', 'By the light of a lanternsuspended from the roof, he perceived a row of black guards sleeping,each with a naked sword lying by him, and he understood that the hallmust form the ante-room to the chamber of some queen or princess', 'Standing quite still, Prince Firouz Schah looked about him, till hiseyes grew accustomed to the gloom, and he noticed a bright lightshining through a curtain in one corner', 'He then made his way softlytowards it, and, drawing aside its folds, passed into a magnificentchamber full of sleeping women, all lying on low couches, except one,who was on a sofa; and this one, he knew, must be the princess', 'Gently stealing up to the side of her bed he looked at her, and sawthat she was more beautiful than any woman he had ever beheld', 'But, fascinated though he was, he was well aware of the dangerof his position, as one cry of surprise would awake the guards,and cause his certain death', 'So sinking quietly on his knees, he took hold of the sleeve ofthe princess and drew her arm lightly towards him', 'The princessopened her eyes, and seeing before her a handsome well-dressed man,she remained speechless with astonishment', 'This favourable moment was seized by the prince, who bowing lowwhile he knelt, thus addressed her:\"You behold, madame, a prince in distress, son to the King of Persia,who, owing to an adventure so strange that you will scarcelybelieve it, finds himself here, a suppliant for your protection', \"But yesterday, I was in my father's court, engaged in the celebrationof our most solemn festival; to-day, I am in an unknown land,in danger of my life\", '\"Now the princess whose mercy Prince Firouz Schah implored was the eldestdaughter of the King of Bengal, who was enjoying rest and change in thepalace her father had built her, at a little distance from the capital', 'She listened kindly to what he had to say, and then answered:\"Prince, be not uneasy; hospitality and humanity are practisedas widely in Bengal as they are in Persia', 'The protection you askwill be given you by all', 'You have my word for it', '\"  And as theprince was about to thank her for her goodness, she added quickly,\"However great may be my curiosity to learn by what means youhave travelled here so speedily, I know that you must be faintfor want of food, so I shall give orders to my women to take youto one of my chambers, where you will be provided with supper,and left to repose', '\"By this time the princess\\'s attendants were all awake, and listeningto the conversation', 'At a sign from their mistress they rose,dressed themselves hastily, and snatching up some of the tapers whichlighted the room, conducted the prince to a large and lofty room,where two of the number prepared his bed, and the rest went downto the kitchen, from which they soon returned with all sortsof dishes', 'Then, showing him cupboards filled with dresses and linen,they quitted the room', 'During their absence the Princess of Bengal, who had been greatly struckby the beauty of the prince, tried in vain to go to sleep again', 'It was of no use:  she felt broad awake, and when her women enteredthe room, she inquired eagerly if the prince had all he wanted,and what they thought of him', '\"Madame,\" they replied, \"it is of course impossible for us to tellwhat impression this young man has made on you', 'For ourselves,we think you would be fortunate if the king your father shouldallow you to marry anyone so amiable', 'Certainly there is no onein the Court of Bengal who can be compared with him', '\"These flattering observations were by no means displeasing tothe princess, but as she did not wish to betray her own feelings shemerely said, \"You are all a set of chatterboxes; go back to bed,and let me sleep', '\"When she dressed the following morning, her maids noticed that,contrary to her usual habit, the princess was very particular abouther toilette, and insisted on her hair being dressed two or threetimes over', '\"For,\" she said to herself, \"if my appearance was notdispleasing to the prince when he saw me in the condition I was,how much more will he be struck with me when he beholds me with allmy charms', '\"Then she placed in her hair the largest and most brilliant diamondsshe could find, with a necklace, bracelets and girdle, all ofprecious stones', 'And over her shoulders her ladies put a robe of therichest stuff in all the Indies, that no one was allowed to wear exceptmembers of the royal family', 'When she was fully dressed accordingto her wishes, she sent to know if the Prince of Persia was awakeand ready to receive her, as she desired to present herself before him', \"When the princess's messenger entered his room, Prince Firouz Schahwas in the act of leaving it, to inquire if he might be allowed to payhis homage to her mistress:  but on hearing the princess's wishes,he at once gave way\", '\"Her will is my law,\" he said, \"I am onlyhere to obey her orders', '\"In a few moments the princess herself appeared, and after the usualcompliments had passed between them, the princess sat down on a sofa,and began to explain to the prince her reasons for not giving himan audience in her own apartments', '\"Had I done so,\" she said,\"we might have been interrupted at any hour by the chief of the eunuchs,who has the right to enter whenever it pleases him, whereas thisis forbidden ground', 'I am all impatience to learn the wonderfulaccident which has procured the pleasure of your arrival, and thatis why I have come to you here, where no one can intrude upon us', 'Begin then, I entreat you, without delay', '\"So the prince began at the beginning, and told all the story of thefestival of Nedrouz held yearly in Persia, and of the splendid spectaclescelebrated in its honour', 'But when he came to the enchanted horse,the princess declared that she could never have imagined anythinghalf so surprising', '\"Well then,\" continued the prince, \"you caneasily understand how the King my father, who has a passion forall curious things, was seized with a violent desire to possessthis horse, and asked the Indian what sum he would take for it', '\"\"The man\\'s answer was absolutely absurd, as you will agree, when Itell you that it was nothing less than the hand of the princessmy sister; but though all the bystanders laughed and mocked,and I was beside myself with rage, I saw to my despair that myfather could not make up his mind to treat the insolent proposalas it deserved', 'I tried to argue with him, but in vain', 'He onlybegged me to examine the horse\" with a view (as I quite understood)of making me more sensible of its value', '\"To please my father, I mounted the horse, and, without waitingfor any instructions from the Indian, turned the peg as I had seenhim do', 'In an instant I was soaring upwards, much quicker thanan arrow could fly, and I felt as if I must be getting so nearthe sky that I should soon hit my head against it', 'I could seenothing beneath me, and for some time was so confused that Idid not even know in what direction I was travelling', 'At last,when it was growing dark, I found another screw, and on turning it,the horse began slowly to sink towards the earth', 'I was forcedto trust to chance, and to see what fate had in store, and it wasalready past midnight when I found myself on the roof of this palace', 'I crept down the little staircase, and made directly for a lightwhich I perceived through an open door--I peeped cautiously in,and saw, as you will guess, the eunuchs lying asleep on the floor', 'I knew the risks I ran, but my need was so great that I paid noattention to them, and stole safely past your guards, to the curtainwhich concealed your doorway', '\"\"The rest, Princess, you know; and it only remains for me to thank youfor the kindness you have shown me, and to assure you of my gratitude', 'By the law of nations, I am already your slave, and I have onlymy heart, that is my own, to offer you', 'But what am I saying', 'My own', 'Alas, madame, it was yours from the first moment Ibeheld you', '\"The air with which he said these words could have left no doubton the mind of the princess as to the effect of her charms,and the blush which mounted to her face only increased her beauty', '\"Prince,\" returned she as soon as her confusion permitted her to speak,\"you have given me the greatest pleasure, and I have followed youclosely in all your adventures, and though you are positivelysitting before me, I even trembled at your danger in the upperregions of the air', 'Let me say what a debt I owe to the chancethat has led you to my house; you could have entered none whichwould have given you a warmer welcome', \"As to your being a slave,of course that is merely a joke, and my reception must itself haveassured you that you are as free here as at your father's court\", 'As to your heart,\" continued she in tones of encouragement,\"I am quite sure that must have been disposed of long ago, to someprincess who is well worthy of it, and I could not think of beingthe cause of your unfaithfulness to her', '\"Prince Firouz Schah was about to protest that there was no ladywith any prior claims, but he was stopped by the entranceof one of the princess\\'s attendants, who announced that dinnerwas served, and, after all, neither was sorry for the interruption', 'Dinner was laid in a magnificent apartment, and the table wascovered with delicious fruits; while during the repast richlydressed girls sang softly and sweetly to stringed instruments', 'After the prince and princess had finished, they passed into a smallroom hung with blue and gold, looking out into a garden stockedwith flowers and arbutus trees, quite different from any that wereto be found in Persia', '\"Princess,\" observed the young man, \"till now I had always believedthat Persia could boast finer palaces and more lovely gardensthan any kingdom upon earth', 'But my eyes have been opened,and I begin to perceive that, wherever there is a great kinghe will surround himself with buildings worthy of him', '\"\"Prince,\" replied the Princess of Bengal, \"I have no idea whata Persian palace is like, so I am unable to make comparisons', 'I do not wish to depreciate my own palace, but I can assure youthat it is very poor beside that of the King my father, as youwill agree when you have been there to greet him, as I hope youwill shortly do', '\"Now the princess hoped that, by bringing about a meetingbetween the prince and her father, the King would be so struckwith the young man\\'s distinguished air and fine manners,that he would offer him his daughter to wife', 'But the replyof the Prince of Persia to her suggestion was not quite what she wished', '\"Madame,\" he said, \"by taking advantage of your proposal to visit thepalace of the King of Bengal, I should satisfy not merely my curiosity,but also the sentiments of respect with which I regard him', 'But, Princess, I am persuaded that you will feel with me, that Icannot possibly present myself before so great a sovereign withoutthe attendants suitable to my rank', 'He would think me an adventurer', '\"\"If that is all,\" she answered, \"you can get as many attendantshere as you please', 'There are plenty of Persian merchants, and asfor money, my treasury is always open to you', 'Take what you please', '\"Prince Firouz Schah guessed what prompted so much kindness on the partof the princess, and was much touched by it', 'Still his passion,which increased every moment, did not make him forget his duty', 'So he replied without hesitation:\"I do not know, Princess, how to express my gratitude for your obligingoffer, which I would accept at once if it were not for the recollectionof all the uneasiness the King my father must be suffering on my account', 'I should be unworthy indeed of all the love he showers upon me,if I did not return to him at the first possible moment', 'For, while Iam enjoying the society of the most amiable of all princesses, he is,I am quite convinced, plunged in the deepest grief, having lost allhope of seeing me again', 'I am sure you will understand my position,and will feel that to remain away one instant longer than isnecessary would not only be ungrateful on my part, but perhapseven a crime, for how do I know if my absence may not break his heart', '\"\"But,\" continued the prince, \"having obeyed the voice of my conscience,I shall count the moments when, with your gracious permission,I may present myself before the King of Bengal, not as a wanderer,but as a prince, to implore the favour of your hand', 'My father hasalways informed me that in my marriage I shall be left quite free,but I am persuaded that I have only to describe your generosity,for my wishes to become his own', '\"The Princess of Bengal was too reasonable not to accept the explanationoffered by Prince Firouz Schah, but she was much disturbed at hisintention of departing at once, for she feared that, no sooner had heleft her, than the impression she had made on him would fade away', 'So she made one more effort to keep him, and after assuring himthat she entirely approved of his anxiety to see his father,begged him to give her a day or two more of his company', 'In common politeness the prince could hardly refuse this request,and the princess set about inventing every kind of amusement for him,and succeeded so well that two months slipped by almost unnoticed,in balls, spectacles and in hunting, of which, when unattendedby danger, the princess was passionately fond', 'But at last, one day,he declared seriously that he could neglect his duty no longer,and entreated her to put no further obstacles in his way, promising atthe same time to return, as soon as he could, with all the magnificencedue both to her and to himself', '\"Princess,\" he added, \"it may be that in your heart you class me withthose false lovers whose devotion cannot stand the test of absence', 'If you do, you wrong me; and were it not for fear of offending you,I would beseech you to come with me, for my life can only be happywhen passed with you', 'As for your reception at the Persian Court,it will be as warm as your merits deserve; and as for what concernsthe King of Bengal, he must be much more indifferent to your welfarethan you have led me to believe if he does not give his consent toour marriage', '\"The princess could not find words in which to reply to the argumentsof the Prince of Persia, but her silence and her downcast eyes spokefor her, and declared that she had no objection to accompanyinghim on his travels', 'The only difficulty that occurred to her was that Prince FirouzSchah did not know how to manage the horse, and she dreadedlest they might find themselves in the same plight as before', 'But the prince soothed her fears so successfully, that she soonhad no other thought than to arrange for their flight so secretly,that no one in the palace should suspect it', \"This was done, and early the following morning, when the whole palacewas wrapped in sleep, she stole up on to the roof, where the princewas already awaiting her, with his horse's head towards Persia\", 'He mounted first and helped the princess up behind; then, when shewas firmly seated, with her hands holding tightly to his belt,he touched the screw, and the horse began to leave the earth quicklybehind him', 'He travelled with his accustomed speed, and Prince Firouz Schah guidedhim so well that in two hours and a half from the time of starting,he saw the capital of Persia lying beneath him', \"He determinedto alight neither in the great square from which he had started,nor in the Sultan's palace, but in a country house at a littledistance from the town\", 'Here he showed the princess a beautifulsuite of rooms, and begged her to rest, while he informed his fatherof their arrival, and prepared a public reception worthy of her rank', 'Then he ordered a horse to be saddled, and set out', 'All the way through the streets he was welcomed with shouts of joyby the people, who had long lost all hope of seeing him again', \"On reaching the palace, he found the Sultan surrounded by his ministers,all clad in the deepest mourning, and his father almost went out of hismind with surprise and delight at the mere sound of his son's voice\", 'When he had calmed down a little, he begged the prince to relatehis adventures', 'The prince at once seized the opening thus given him, and toldthe whole story of his treatment by the Princess of Bengal,not even concealing the fact that she had fallen in love with him', '\"And, Sire,\" ended the prince, \"having given my royal word that youwould not refuse your consent to our marriage, I persuaded herto return with me on the Indian\\'s horse', \"I have left her in oneof your Highness's country houses, where she is waiting anxiouslyto be assured that I have not promised in vain\", '\"As he said this the prince was about to throw himself at the feetof the Sultan, but his father prevented him, and embracing him again,said eagerly:\"My son, not only do I gladly consent to your marriage with thePrincess of Bengal, but I will hasten to pay my respects to her,and to thank her in my own person for the benefits she hasconferred on you', 'I will then bring her back with me, and makeall arrangements for the wedding to be celebrated to-day', '\"So the Sultan gave orders that the habits of mourningworn by the people should be thrown off and that thereshould be a concert of drums, trumpets and cymbals', 'Also that the Indian should be taken from prison, and brought before him', 'His commands were obeyed, and the Indian was led into his presence,surrounded by guards', '\"I have kept you locked up,\" said the Sultan,\"so that in case my son was lost, your life should pay the penalty', 'He has now returned; so take your horse, and begone for ever', '\"The Indian hastily quitted the presence of the Sultan, and when hewas outside, he inquired of the man who had taken him out of prisonwhere the prince had really been all this time, and what he hadbeen doing', \"They told him the whole story, and how the Princessof Bengal was even then awaiting in the country palace the consentof the Sultan, which at once put into the Indian's head a planof revenge for the treatment he had experienced\", 'Going straight tothe country house, he informed the doorkeeper who was left in chargethat he had been sent by the Sultan and by the Prince of Persia tofetch the princess on the enchanted horse, and to bring her to the palace', 'The doorkeeper knew the Indian by sight, and was of course awarethat nearly three months before he had been thrown into prisonby the Sultan; and seeing him at liberty, the man took for grantedthat he was speaking the truth, and made no difficulty aboutleading him before the Princess of Bengal; while on her side,hearing that he had come from the prince, the lady gladly consentedto do what he wished', 'The Indian, delighted with the success of his scheme,mounted the horse, assisted the princess to mount behind him,and turned the peg at the very moment that the prince was leavingthe palace in Schiraz for the country house, followed closely by theSultan and all the court', 'Knowing this, the Indian deliberatelysteered the horse right above the city, in order that his revengefor his unjust imprisonment might be all the quicker and sweeter', 'When the Sultan of Persia saw the horse and its riders, he stopped shortwith astonishment and horror, and broke out into oaths and curses,which the Indian heard quite unmoved, knowing that he was perfectlysafe from pursuit', 'But mortified and furious as the Sultan was,his feelings were nothing to those of Prince Firouz Schah, when hesaw the object of his passionate devotion being borne rapidly away', 'And while he was struck speechless with grief and remorse at nothaving guarded her better, she vanished swiftly out of his sight', 'What was he to do', 'Should he follow his father into the palace,and there give reins to his despair', 'Both his love and his couragealike forbade it; and he continued his way to the palace', \"The sight of the prince showed the doorkeeper of what folly hehad been guilty, and flinging himself at his master's feet,implored his pardon\", '\"Rise,\" said the prince, \"I am the cause ofthis misfortune, and not you', 'Go and find me the dress of a dervish,but beware of saying it is for me', '\"At a short distance from the country house, a convent of dervisheswas situated, and the superior, or scheih, was the doorkeeper\\'s friend', \"So by means of a false story made up on the spur of the moment,it was easy enough to get hold of a dervish's dress, which theprince at once put on, instead of his own\", 'Disguised like thisand concealing about him a box of pearls and diamonds he had intendedas a present to the princess, he left the house at nightfall,uncertain where he should go, but firmly resolved not to returnwithout her', 'Meanwhile the Indian had turned the horse in such a direction that,before many hours had passed, it had entered a wood close tothe capital of the kingdom of Cashmere', 'Feeling very hungry,and supposing that the princess also might be in want of food,he brought his steed down to the earth, and left the princessin a shady place, on the banks of a clear stream', 'At first, when the princess had found herself alone, the ideahad occurred to her of trying to escape and hide herself', 'But as she had eaten scarcely anything since she had left Bengal,she felt she was too weak to venture far, and was obliged toabandon her design', 'On the return of the Indian with meats ofvarious kinds, she began to eat voraciously, and soon had regainedsufficient courage to reply with spirit to his insolent remarks', 'Goaded by his threats she sprang to her feet, calling loudlyfor help, and luckily her cries were heard by a troop of horsemen,who rode up to inquire what was the matter', 'Now the leader of these horsemen was the Sultan of Cashmere,returning from the chase, and he instantly turned to the Indianto inquire who he was, and whom he had with him', 'The Indian rudelyanswered that it was his wife, and there was no occasion for anyoneelse to interfere between them', \"The princess, who, of course, was ignorant of the rank ofher deliverer, denied altogether the Indian's story\", '\"My lord,\"she cried, \"whoever you may be, put no faith in this impostor', 'He is an abominable magician, who has this day torn me from thePrince of Persia, my destined husband, and has brought me here onthis enchanted horse', '\"  She would have continued, but her tearschoked her, and the Sultan of Cashmere, convinced by her beautyand her distinguished air of the truth of her tale, ordered hisfollowers to cut off the Indian\\'s head, which was done immediately', 'But rescued though she was from one peril, it seemed as if shehad only fallen into another', 'The Sultan commanded a horse tobe given her, and conducted her to his own palace, where he ledher to a beautiful apartment, and selected female slaves to waiton her, and eunuchs to be her guard', 'Then, without allowingher time to thank him for all he had done, he bade her repose,saying she should tell him her adventures on the following day', 'The princess fell asleep, flattering herself that she had onlyto relate her story for the Sultan to be touched by compassion,and to restore her to the prince without delay', 'But a few hourswere to undeceive her', 'When the King of Cashmere had quitted her presence the evening before,he had resolved that the sun should not set again without the princessbecoming his wife, and at daybreak proclamation of his intention wasmade throughout the town, by the sound of drums, trumpets, cymbals,and other instruments calculated to fill the heart with joy', 'The Princess of Bengal was early awakened by the noise, but she didnot for one moment imagine that it had anything to do with her,till the Sultan, arriving as soon as she was dressed to inquireafter her health, informed her that the trumpet blasts she heardwere part of the solemn marriage ceremonies, for which he beggedher to prepare', 'This unexpected announcement caused the princesssuch terror that she sank down in a dead faint', 'The slaves that were in waiting ran to her aid, and the Sultanhimself did his best to bring her back to consciousness, but fora long while it was all to no purpose', 'At length her sensesbegan slowly to come back to her, and then, rather than breakfaith with the Prince of Persia by consenting to such a marriage,she determined to feign madness', 'So she began by saying allsorts of absurdities, and using all kinds of strange gestures,while the Sultan stood watching her with sorrow and surprise', 'But as this sudden seizure showed no sign of abating, he lefther to her women, ordering them to take the greatest care of her', 'Still, as the day went on, the malady seemed to become worse,and by night it was almost violent', 'Days passed in this manner, till at last the Sultan of Cashmeredecided to summon all the doctors of his court to consult togetherover her sad state', 'Their answer was that madness is of so manydifferent kinds that it was impossible to give an opinion onthe case without seeing the princess, so the Sultan gave ordersthat they were to be introduced into her chamber, one by one,every man according to his rank', 'This decision had been foreseen by the princess, who knew quitewell that if once she allowed the physicians to feel her pulse,the most ignorant of them would discover that she was in perfectlygood health, and that her madness was feigned, so as each man approached,she broke out into such violent paroxysms, that not one dared to laya finger on her', 'A few, who pretended to be cleverer than the rest,declared that they could diagnose sick people only from sight,ordered her certain potions, which she made no difficulty about taking,as she was persuaded they were all harmless', 'When the Sultan of Cashmere saw that the court doctors could donothing towards curing the princess, he called in those of the city,who fared no better', \"Then he had recourse to the most celebratedphysicians in the other large towns, but finding that the taskwas beyond their science, he finally sent messengers into the otherneighbouring states, with a memorandum containing full particularsof the princess's madness, offering at the same time to paythe expenses of any physician who would come and see for himself,and a handsome reward to the one who should cure her\", 'In answerto this proclamation many foreign professors flocked into Cashmere,but they naturally were not more successful than the rest had been,as the cure depended neither on them nor their skill, but only onthe princess herself', 'It was during this time that Prince Firouz Schah, wandering sadlyand hopelessly from place to place, arrived in a large city of India,where he heard a great deal of talk about the Princess of Bengal whohad gone out of her senses, on the very day that she was to have beenmarried to the Sultan of Cashmere', 'This was quite enough to inducehim to take the road to Cashmere, and to inquire at the first innat which he lodged in the capital the full particulars of the story', 'When he knew that he had at last found the princess whom he hadso long lost, he set about devising a plan for her rescue', \"The first thing he did was to procure a doctor's robe, so that his dress,added to the long beard he had allowed to grow on his travels,might unmistakably proclaim his profession\", 'He then lost no timein going to the palace, where he obtained an audience of thechief usher, and while apologising for his boldness in presumingto think that he could cure the princess, where so many othershad failed, declared that he had the secret of certain remedies,which had hitherto never failed of their effect', 'The chief usher assured him that he was heartily welcome, and thatthe Sultan would receive him with pleasure; and in case of success,he would gain a magnificent reward', 'When the Prince of Persia, in the disguise of a physician, was broughtbefore him, the Sultan wasted no time in talking, beyond remarkingthat the mere sight of a doctor threw the princess into transportsof rage', 'He then led the prince up to a room under the roof,which had an opening through which he might observe the princess,without himself being seen', 'The prince looked, and beheld the princess reclining on a sofawith tears in her eyes, singing softly to herself a song bewailingher sad destiny, which had deprived her, perhaps for ever,of a being she so tenderly loved', \"The young man's heart beat fastas he listened, for he needed no further proof that her madnesswas feigned, and that it was love of him which had caused her toresort to this species of trick\", \"He softly left his hiding-place,and returned to the Sultan, to whom he reported that he was surefrom certain signs that the princess's malady was not incurable,but that he must see her and speak with her alone\", \"The Sultan made no difficulty in consenting to this, and commandedthat he should be ushered in to the princess's apartment\", \"The moment she caught sight of his physician's robe, she sprangfrom her seat in a fury, and heaped insults upon him\", 'The princetook no notice of her behaviour, and approaching quite close,so that his words might be heard by her alone, he said in a low whisper,\"Look at me, princess, and you will see that I am no doctor,but the Prince of Persia, who has come to set you free', '\"At the sound of his voice, the Princess of Bengal suddenly grew calm,and an expression of joy overspread her face, such as only comeswhen what we wish for most and expect the least suddenly happensto us', 'For some time she was too enchanted to speak, and PrinceFirouz Schah took advantage of her silence to explain to her allthat had occurred, his despair at watching her disappear beforehis very eyes, the oath he had sworn to follow her over the world,and his rapture at finally discovering her in the palace at Cashmere', 'When he had finished, he begged in his turn that the princess wouldtell him how she had come there, so that he might the better devisesome means of rescuing her from the tyranny of the Sultan', 'It needed but a few words from the princess to make him acquaintedwith the whole situation, and how she had been forced to play the partof a mad woman in order to escape from a marriage with the Sultan,who had not had sufficient politeness even to ask her consent', 'If necessary, she added, she had resolved to die sooner than permitherself to be forced into such a union, and break faith with a princewhom she loved', \"The prince then inquired if she knew what had become of theenchanted horse since the Indian's death, but the princess couldonly reply that she had heard nothing about it\", 'Still she didnot suppose that the horse could have been forgotten by the Sultan,after all she had told him of its value', 'To this the prince agreed, and they consulted together over a planby which she might be able to make her escape and return with himinto Persia', 'And as the first step, she was to dress herselfwith care, and receive the Sultan with civility when he visitedher next morning', \"The Sultan was transported with delight on learning the resultof the interview, and his opinion of the doctor's skill was raisedstill higher when, on the following day, the princess behavedtowards him in such a way as to persuade him that her completecure would not be long delayed\", 'However he contented himself withassuring her how happy he was to see her health so much improved,and exhorted her to make every use of so clever a physician,and to repose entire confidence in him', 'Then he retired,without awaiting any reply from the princess', \"The Prince of Persia left the room at the same time, and askedif he might be allowed humbly to inquire by what means the Princessof Bengal had reached Cashmere, which was so far distant from herfather's kingdom, and how she came to be there alone\", 'The Sultanthought the question very natural, and told him the same storythat the Princess of Bengal had done, adding that he had orderedthe enchanted horse to be taken to his treasury as a curiosity,though he was quite ignorant how it could be used', '\"Sire,\" replied the physician, \"your Highness\\'s tale has supplied mewith the clue I needed to complete the recovery of the princess', 'During her voyage hither on an enchanted horse, a portion of itsenchantment has by some means been communicated to her person,and it can only be dissipated by certain perfumes of which I possessthe secret', 'If your Highness will deign to consent, and to givethe court and the people one of the most astonishing spectacles theyhave ever witnessed, command the horse to be brought into the bigsquare outside the palace, and leave the rest to me', 'I promise thatin a very few moments, in presence of all the assembled multitude,you shall see the princess as healthy both in mind and body as evershe was in her life', 'And in order to make the spectacle as impressiveas possible, I would suggest that she should be richly dressedand covered with the noblest jewels of the crown', '\"The Sultan readily agreed to all that the prince proposed,and the following morning he desired that the enchanted horseshould be taken from the treasury, and brought into the great squareof the palace', 'Soon the rumour began to spread through the town,that something extraordinary was about to happen, and such a crowdbegan to collect that the guards had to be called out to keep order,and to make a way for the enchanted horse', 'When all was ready, the Sultan appeared, and took his place ona platform, surrounded by the chief nobles and officers of his court', 'When they were seated, the Princess of Bengal was seen leavingthe palace, accompanied by the ladies who had been assignedto her by the Sultan', 'She slowly approached the enchanted horse,and with the help of her ladies, she mounted on its back', 'Directly she was in the saddle, with her feet in the stirrupsand the bridle in her hand, the physician placed around the horsesome large braziers full of burning coals, into each of which hethrew a perfume composed of all sorts of delicious scents', 'Then hecrossed his hands over his breast, and with lowered eyes walkedthree times round the horse, muttering the while certain words', 'Soon there arose from the burning braziers a thick smoke which almostconcealed both the horse and princess, and this was the moment forwhich he had been waiting', 'Springing lightly up behind the lady,he leaned forward and turned the peg, and as the horse darted up intothe air, he cried aloud so that his words were heard by all present,\"Sultan of Cashmere, when you wish to marry princesses who havesought your protection, learn first to gain their consent', '\"It was in this way that the Prince of Persia rescued the Princessof Bengal, and returned with her to Persia, where they descendedthis time before the palace of the King himself', 'The marriagewas only delayed just long enough to make the ceremony as brilliantas possible, and, as soon as the rejoicings were over, an ambassadorwas sent to the King of Bengal, to inform him of what had passed,and to ask his approbation of the alliance between the two countries,which he heartily gave', 'The Story of Two Sisters Who Were Jealous of Their Younger SisterOnce upon a time there reigned over Persia a Sultan named Kosrouschah,who from his boyhood had been fond of putting on a disguise and seekingadventures in all parts of the city, accompanied by one of his officers,disguised like himself', 'And no sooner was his father buriedand the ceremonies over that marked his accession to the throne,than the young man hastened to throw off his robes of state,and calling to his vizir to make ready likewise, stole out in the simpledress of a private citizen into the less known streets of the capital', \"Passing down a lonely street, the Sultan heard women's voicesin loud discussion; and peeping through a crack in the door, he sawthree sisters, sitting on a sofa in a large hall, talking in a verylively and earnest manner\", 'Judging from the few words that reachedhis ear, they were each explaining what sort of men they wished to marry', '\"I ask nothing better,\" cried the eldest, \"than to have the Sultan\\'sbaker for a husband', 'Think of being able to eat as much as one wanted,of that delicious bread that is baked for his Highness alone', 'Let us see if your wish is as good as mine', '\"\"I,\" replied the second sister, \"should be quite contentwith the Sultan\\'s head cook', 'What delicate stews I shouldfeast upon', \"And, as I am persuaded that the Sultan's bread is usedall through the palace, I should have that into the bargain\", 'You see, my dear sister, my taste is as good as yours', '\"It was now the turn of the youngest sister, who was by far the mostbeautiful of the three, and had, besides, more sense than theother two', '\"As for me,\" she said, \"I should take a higher flight;and if we are to wish for husbands, nothing less than the Sultanhimself will do for me', '\"The Sultan was so much amused by the conversation he had overheard,that he made up his mind to gratify their wishes, and turning tothe grand-vizir, he bade him note the house, and on the followingmorning to bring the ladies into his presence', 'The grand-vizir fulfilled his commission, and hardly givingthem time to change their dresses, desired the three sistersto follow him to the palace', 'Here they were presented one by one,and when they had bowed before the Sultan, the sovereign abruptlyput the question to them:\"Tell me, do you remember what you wished for last night, when youwere making merry', 'Fear nothing, but answer me the truth', '\"These words, which were so unexpected, threw the sisters intogreat confusion, their eyes fell, and the blushes of the youngestdid not fail to make an impression on the heart of the Sultan', 'All three remained silent, and he hastened to continue:  \"Do notbe afraid, I have not the slightest intention of giving you pain,and let me tell you at once, that I know the wishes formed byeach one', 'You,\" he said, turning to the youngest, \"who desired tohave me for an husband, shall be satisfied this very day', 'And you,\"he added, addressing himself to the other two, \"shall be marriedat the same moment to my baker and to my chief cook', '\"When the Sultan had finished speaking the three sisters flungthemselves at his feet, and the youngest faltered out, \"Oh, sire,since you know my foolish words, believe, I pray you, that they wereonly said in joke', 'I am unworthy of the honour you propose to do me,and I can only ask pardon for my boldness', '\"The other sisters also tried to excuse themselves, but the Sultanwould hear nothing', '\"No, no,\" he said, \"my mind is made up', 'Your wishes shallbe accomplished', '\"So the three weddings were celebrated that same day, but with agreat difference', \"That of the youngest was marked by all themagnificence that was customary at the marriage of the Shah of Persia,while the festivities attending the nuptials of the Sultan's bakerand his chief cook were only such as were suitable to their conditions\", 'This, though quite natural, was highly displeasing to the eldersisters, who fell into a passion of jealousy, which in the endcaused a great deal of trouble and pain to several people', 'And the first time that they had the opportunity of speaking toeach other, which was not till several days later at a public bath,they did not attempt to disguise their feelings', '\"Can you possibly understand what the Sultan saw in that little cat,\"said one to the other, \"for him to be so fascinated by her', '\"\"He must be quite blind,\" returned the wife of the chief cook', '\"As for her looking a little younger than we do, what does that matter', 'You would have made a far better Sultana than she', '\"\"Oh, I say nothing of myself,\" replied the elder, \"and if theSultan had chosen you it would have been all very well; but itreally grieves me that he should have selected a wretched littlecreature like that', 'However, I will be revenged on her somehow,and I beg you will give me your help in the matter, and to tellme anything that you can think of that is likely to mortify her', '\"In order to carry out their wicked scheme the two sisters metconstantly to talk over their ideas, though all the while theypretended to be as friendly as ever towards the Sultana, who,on her part, invariably treated them with kindness', 'For a longtime no plan occurred to the two plotters that seemed in theleast likely to meet with success, but at length the expectedbirth of an heir gave them the chance for which they had been hoping', 'They obtained permission of the Sultan to take up their abode in thepalace for some weeks, and never left their sister night or day', 'When at last a little boy, beautiful as the sun, was born, they laidhim in his cradle and carried it down to a canal which passedthrough the grounds of the palace', 'Then, leaving it to its fate,they informed the Sultan that instead of the son he had so fondlydesired the Sultana had given birth to a puppy', 'At this dreadfulnews the Sultan was so overcome with rage and grief that it was withgreat difficulty that the grand-vizir managed to save the Sultanafrom his wrath', 'Meanwhile the cradle continued to float peacefully along the canal till,on the outskirts of the royal gardens, it was suddenly perceivedby the intendant, one of the highest and most respected officialsin the kingdom', '\"Go,\" he said to a gardener who was working near, \"and get thatcradle out for me', '\"The gardener did as he was bid, and soon placed the cradlein the hands of the intendant', 'The official was much astonished to see that the cradle, which he hadsupposed to be empty, contained a baby, which, young though it was,already gave promise of great beauty', 'Having no children himself,although he had been married some years, it at once occurred to himthat here was a child which he could take and bring up as his own', 'And, bidding the man pick up the cradle and follow him, he turnedtowards home', '\"My wife,\" he exclaimed as he entered the room, \"heaven has deniedus any children, but here is one that has been sent in their place', 'Send for a nurse, and I will do what is needful publicly to recogniseit as my son', '\"The wife accepted the baby with joy, and though the intendant sawquite well that it must have come from the royal palace, he didnot think it was his business to inquire further into the mystery', 'The following year another prince was born and sent adrift,but happily for the baby, the intendant of the gardens againwas walking by the canal, and carried it home as before', 'The Sultan, naturally enough, was still more furious the second timethan the first, but when the same curious accident was repeatedin the third year he could control himself no longer, and, to thegreat joy of the jealous sisters, commanded that the Sultana shouldbe executed', \"But the poor lady was so much beloved at Court that noteven the dread of sharing her fate could prevent the grand-vizirand the courtiers from throwing themselves at the Sultan's feetand imploring him not to inflict so cruel a punishment for what,after all, was not her fault\", '\"Let her live,\" entreated the grand-vizir, \"and banish herfrom your presence for the rest of her days', 'That in itselfwill be punishment enough', '\"His first passion spent, the Sultan had regained his self-command', '\"Let her live then,\" he said, \"since you have it so much at heart', 'But if I grant her life it shall only be on one condition, which shallmake her daily pray for death', 'Let a box be built for her at the doorof the principal mosque, and let the window of the box be always open', 'There she shall sit, in the coarsest clothes, and every Mussulmanwho enters the mosque shall spit in her face in passing', 'Anyone thatrefuses to obey shall be exposed to the same punishment himself', 'You, vizir, will see that my orders are carried out', '\"The grand-vizir saw that it was useless to say more, and, full of triumph,the sisters watched the building of the box, and then listened to thejeers of the people at the helpless Sultana sitting inside', 'But the poorlady bore herself with so much dignity and meekness that it was not longbefore she had won the sympathy of those that were best among the crowd', 'But it is now-time to return to the fate of the third baby,this time a princess', 'Like its brothers, it was found by theintendant of the gardens, and adopted by him and his wife,and all three were brought up with the greatest care and tenderness', 'As the children grew older their beauty and air of distinctionbecame more and more marked, and their manners had all the graceand ease that is proper to people of high birth', 'The princes hadbeen named by their foster-father Bahman and Perviz, after two ofthe ancient kings of Persia, while the princess was called Parizade,or the child of the genii', 'The intendant was careful to bring them up as befitted theirreal rank, and soon appointed a tutor to teach the young princeshow to read and write', 'And the princess, determined not to beleft behind, showed herself so anxious to learn with her brothers,that the intendant consented to her joining in their lessons,and it was not long before she knew as much as they did', 'From that time all their studies were done in common', 'They had the bestmasters for the fine arts, geography, poetry, history and science,and even for sciences which are learned by few, and every branch seemedso easy to them, that their teachers were astonished at the progressthey made', 'The princess had a passion for music, and could singand play upon all sorts of instruments she could also ride and driveas well as her brothers, shoot with a bow and arrow, and throwa javelin with the same skill as they, and sometimes even better', 'In order to set off these accomplishments, the intendant resolvedthat his foster children should not be pent up any longer in thenarrow borders of the palace gardens, where he had always lived,so he bought a splendid country house a few miles from the capital,surrounded by an immense park', 'This park he filled with wild beastsof various sorts, so that the princes and princess might hunt as muchas they pleased', \"When everything was ready, the intendant threw himself at theSultan's feet, and after referring to his age and his long services,begged his Highness's permission to resign his post\", 'This was grantedby the Sultan in a few gracious words, and he then inquired what rewardhe could give to his faithful servant', \"But the intendant declared thathe wished for nothing except the continuance of his Highness's favour,and prostrating himself once more, he retired from the Sultan's presence\", 'Five or six months passed away in the pleasures of the country,when death attacked the intendant so suddenly that he had no timeto reveal the secret of their birth to his adopted children,and as his wife had long been dead also, it seemed as if the princesand the princess would never know that they had been born to ahigher station than the one they filled', 'Their sorrow for theirfather was very deep, and they lived quietly on in their new home,without feeling any desire to leave it for court gaieties or intrigues', 'One day the princes as usual went out to hunt, but their sisterremained alone in her apartments', 'While they were gone an oldMussulman devotee appeared at the door, and asked leave to enter,as it was the hour of prayer', 'The princess sent orders at once thatthe old woman was to be taken to the private oratory in the grounds,and when she had finished her prayers was to be shown the houseand gardens, and then to be brought before her', 'Although the old woman was very pious, she was not at allindifferent to the magnificence of all around her, which sheseemed to understand as well as to admire, and when she hadseen it all she was led by the servants before the princess,who was seated in a room which surpassed in splendour all the rest', '\"My good woman,\" said the princess pointing to a sofa, \"come and sitbeside me', 'I am delighted at the opportunity of speaking for a fewmoments with so holy a person', '\"  The old woman made some objectionsto so much honour being done her, but the princess refused to listen,and insisted that her guest should take the best seat, and as shethought she must be tired ordered refreshments', 'While the old woman was eating, the princess put several questionsto her as to her mode of life, and the pious exercises she practiced,and then inquired what she thought of the house now that she hadseen it', '\"Madam,\" replied the pilgrim, \"one must be hard indeed to pleaseto find any fault', 'It is beautiful, comfortable and well ordered,and it is impossible to imagine anything more lovely than the garden', 'But since you ask me, I must confess that it lacks three thingsto make it absolutely perfect', '\"\"And what can they be', '\" cried the princess', '\"Only tell me, and Iwill lose no time in getting them', '\"\"The three things, madam,\" replied the old woman, \"are, first,the Talking Bird, whose voice draws all other singing birds to it,to join in chorus', 'And second, the Singing Tree, where every leafis a song that is never silent', 'And lastly the Golden Water,of which it is only needful to pour a single drop into a basinfor it to shoot up into a fountain, which will never be exhausted,nor will the basin ever overflow', '\"\"Oh, how can I thank you,\" cried the princess, \"for telling me ofsuch treasures', 'But add, I pray you', 'to your goodness by furtherinforming me where I can find them', '\"\"Madam,\" replied the pilgrim, \"I should ill repay the hospitalityyou have shown me if I refused to answer your question', 'The threethings of which I have spoken are all to be found in one place,on the borders of this kingdom, towards India', 'Your messenger hasonly to follow the road that passes by your house, for twenty days,and at the end of that time, he is to ask the first person he meetsfor the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water', '\" She then rose, and bidding farewell to the princess, went her way', 'The old woman had taken her departure so abruptly that the PrincessParizade did not perceive till she was really gone that the directionswere hardly clear enough to enable the search to be successful', 'And she was still thinking of the subject, and how delightful itwould be to possess such rarities, when the princes, her brothers,returned from the chase', '\"What is the matter, my sister', '\" asked Prince Bahman; \"why are youso grave', 'Are you ill', 'or has anything happened', '\"Princess Parizade did not answer directly, but at length she raisedher eyes, and replied that there was nothing wrong', '\"But there must be something,\" persisted Prince Bahman, \"for youto have changed so much during the short time we have been absent', 'Hide nothing from us, I beseech you, unless you wish us to believethat the confidence we have always had in one another is nowto cease', '\"\"When I said that it was nothing,\" said the princess, moved byhis words, \"I meant that it was nothing that affected you, although Iadmit that it is certainly of some importance to me', 'Like myself,you have always thought this house that our father built for us wasperfect in every respect, but only to-day I have learned that threethings are still lacking to complete it', 'These are the Talking Bird,the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water', '\"  After explaining the peculiarqualities of each, the princess continued:  \"It was a Mussulmandevotee who told me all this, and where they might all be found', 'Perhaps you will think that the house is beautiful enough as it is,and that we can do quite well without them; but in this I cannotagree with you, and I shall never be content until I have got them', 'So counsel me, I pray, whom to send on the undertaking', '\"\"My dear sister,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"that you should careabout the matter is quite enough, even if we took no interest init ourselves', 'But we both feel with you, and I claim, as the elder,the right to make the first attempt, if you will tell me where Iam to go, and what steps I am to take', '\"Prince Perviz at first objected that, being the head of the family,his brother ought not to be allowed to expose himself to danger;but Prince Bahman would hear nothing, and retired to make the needfulpreparations for his journey', 'The next morning Prince Bahman got up very early, and afterbidding farewell to his brother and sister, mounted his horse', 'But just as he was about to touch it with his whip, he was stoppedby a cry from the princess', '\"Oh, perhaps after all you may never come back; one never can tellwhat accidents may happen', 'Give it up, I implore you, for I woulda thousand times rather lose the Talking Bird, and the Singing Treeand the Golden Water, than that you should run into danger', '\"\"My dear sister,\" answered the prince, \"accidents only happento unlucky people, and I hope that I am not one of them', 'But as everything is uncertain, I promise you to be very careful', 'Take this knife,\" he continued, handing her one that hung sheathedfrom his belt, \"and every now and then draw it out and look at it', 'As long as it keeps bright and clean as it is to-day, you will knowthat I am living; but if the blade is spotted with blood, it will bea sign that I am dead, and you shall weep for me', '\"So saying, Prince Bahman bade them farewell once more, and startedon the high road, well mounted and fully armed', 'For twenty days herode straight on, turning neither to the right hand nor to the left,till he found himself drawing near the frontiers of Persia', 'Seated under a tree by the wayside he noticed a hideous old man,with a long white moustache, and beard that almost fell to his feet', 'His nails had grown to an enormous length, and on his head he wore ahuge hat, which served him for an umbrella', 'Prince Bahman, who, remembering the directions of the old woman,had been since sunrise on the look-out for some one, recognised theold man at once to be a dervish', 'He dismounted from his horse,and bowed low before the holy man, saying by way of greeting,\"My father, may your days be long in the land, and may all your wishesbe fulfilled', '\"The dervish did his best to reply, but his moustache was so thick thathis words were hardly intelligible, and the prince, perceiving whatwas the matter, took a pair of scissors from his saddle pockets,and requested permission to cut off some of the moustache, as he hada question of great importance to ask the dervish', 'The dervish madea sign that he might do as he liked, and when a few inches of his hairand beard had been pruned all round the prince assured the holy manthat he would hardly believe how much younger he looked', 'The dervishsmiled at his compliments, and thanked him for what he had done', '\"Let me,\" he said, \"show you my gratitude for making me morecomfortable by telling me what I can do for you', '\"\"Gentle dervish,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"I come from far, and Iseek the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree, and the Golden Water', 'I know that they are to be found somewhere in these parts, but I amignorant of the exact spot', 'Tell me, I pray you, if you can, so that Imay not have travelled on a useless quest', '\"  While he was speaking,the prince observed a change in the countenance of the dervish,who waited for some time before he made reply', '\"My lord,\" he said at last, \"I do know the road for which you ask,but your kindness and the friendship I have conceived for you makeme loth to point it out', '\"\"But why not', '\" inquired the prince', '\"What danger can there be', '\"\"The very greatest danger,\" answered the dervish', '\"Other men,as brave as you, have ridden down this road, and have put methat question', 'I did my best to turn them also from their purpose,but it was of no use', 'Not one of them would listen to my words,and not one of them came back', 'Be warned in time, and seek to gono further', '\"\"I am grateful to you for your interest in me,\" said Prince Bahman,\"and for the advice you have given, though I cannot follow it', 'But what dangers can there be in the adventure which courage and a goodsword cannot meet', '\"\"And suppose,\" answered the dervish, \"that your enemies are invisible,how then', '\"\"Nothing will make me give it up,\" replied the prince, \"and forthe last time I ask you to tell me where I am to go', '\"When the dervish saw that the prince\\'s mind was made up,he drew a ball from a bag that lay near him, and held it out', '\"If it must be so,\" he said, with a sigh, \"take this, and whenyou have mounted your horse throw the ball in front of you', 'It will roll on till it reaches the foot of a mountain, and when itstops you will stop also', \"You will then throw the bridle on yourhorse's neck without any fear of his straying, and will dismount\", 'On each side you will see vast heaps of big black stones,and will hear a multitude of insulting voices, but pay no heedto them, and, above all, beware of ever turning your head', 'If you do, you will instantly become a black stone like the rest', 'For those stones are in reality men like yourself, who have been onthe same quest, and have failed, as I fear that you may fail also', 'If you manage to avoid this pitfall, and to reach the top ofthe mountain, you will find there the Talking Bird in a splendid cage,and you can ask of him where you are to seek the Singing Tree andthe Golden Water', 'That is all I have to say', 'You know what youhave to do, and what to avoid, but if you are wise you will thinkof it no more, but return whence you have come', '\"The prince smilingly shook his head, and thanking the dervishonce more, he sprang on his horse and threw the ball before him', 'The ball rolled along the road so fast that Prince Bahman had muchdifficulty in keeping up with it, and it never relaxed its speedtill the foot of the mountain was reached', \"Then it came to asudden halt, and the prince at once got down and flung the bridleon his horse's neck\", 'He paused for a moment and looked round himat the masses of black stones with which the sides of the mountainwere covered, and then began resolutely to ascend', 'He had hardlygone four steps when he heard the sound of voices around him,although not another creature was in sight', '\"Who is this imbecile', '\" cried some, \"stop him at once', '\"  \"Kill him,\"shrieked others, \"Help', 'robbers', 'murderers', 'help', 'help', '\"  \"Oh, lethim alone,\" sneered another, and this was the most trying of all,\"he is such a beautiful young man; I am sure the bird and the cagemust have been kept for him', '\"At first the prince took no heed to all this clamour, but continuedto press forward on his way', 'Unfortunately this conduct, instead ofsilencing the voices, only seemed to irritate them the more,and they arose with redoubled fury, in front as well as behind', 'After some time he grew bewildered, his knees began to tremble,and finding himself in the act of falling, he forgot altogetherthe advice of the dervish', 'He turned to fly down the mountain,and in one moment became a black stone', 'As may be imagined, Prince Perviz and his sister were all thistime in the greatest anxiety, and consulted the magic knife,not once but many times a day', 'Hitherto the blade had remainedbright and spotless, but on the fatal hour on which Prince Bahmanand his horse were changed into black stones, large drops of bloodappeared on the surface', '\"Ah', 'my beloved brother,\" cried the princessin horror, throwing the knife from her, \"I shall never see you again,and it is I who have killed you', 'Fool that I was to listen to thevoice of that temptress, who probably was not speaking the truth', 'What are the Talking Bird and the Singing Tree to me in comparisonwith you, passionately though I long for them', '\"Prince Perviz\\'s grief at his brother\\'s loss was not less than that ofPrincess Parizade, but he did not waste his time on useless lamentations', '\"My sister,\" he said, \"why should you think the old woman was deceivingyou about these treasures, and what would have been her object indoing so', 'No, no, our brother must have met his death by some accident,or want of precaution, and to-morrow I will start on the same quest', '\"Terrified at the thought that she might lose her only remainingbrother, the princess entreated him to give up his project,but he remained firm', 'Before setting out, however, he gave her achaplet of a hundred pearls, and said, \"When I am absent, tell thisover daily for me', \"But if you should find that the beads stick,so that they will not slip one after the other, you will know thatmy brother's fate has befallen me\", 'Still, we must hope for better luck', '\"Then he departed, and on the twentieth day of his journey fellin with the dervish on the same spot as Prince Bahman had met him,and began to question him as to the place where the Talking Bird,the Singing Tree and the Golden Water were to be found', 'As in the caseof his brother, the dervish tried to make him give up his project,and even told him that only a few weeks since a young man,bearing a strong resemblance to him-self, had passed that way,but had never come back again', '\"That, holy dervish,\" replied Prince Perviz, \"was my elder brother,who is now dead, though how he died I cannot say', '\"\"He is changed into a black stone,\" answered the dervish, \"like allthe rest who have gone on the same errand, and you will become onelikewise if you are not more careful in following my directions', '\" Then he charged the prince, as he valued his life, to take no heedof the clamour of voices that would pursue him up the mountain,and handing him a ball from the bag, which still seemed to be half full,he sent him on his way', 'When Prince Perviz reached the foot of the mountain he jumped fromhis horse, and paused for a moment to recall the instructions thedervish had given him', 'Then he strode boldly on, but had scarcelygone five or six paces when he was startled by a man\\'s voicethat seemed close to his ear, exclaiming:  \"Stop, rash fellow,and let me punish your audacity', '\"  This outrage entirely putthe dervish\\'s advice out of the prince\\'s head', 'He drew his sword,and turned to avenge himself, but almost before he had realisedthat there was nobody there, he and his horse were two black stones', \"Not a morning had passed since Prince Perviz had ridden away withoutPrincess Parizade telling her beads, and at night she even hungthem round her neck, so that if she woke she could assure herselfat once of her brother's safety\", 'She was in the very act of movingthem through her fingers at the moment that the prince fell a victimto his impatience, and her heart sank when the first pearl remainedfixed in its place', 'However she had long made up her mind what shewould do in such a case, and the following morning the princess,disguised as a man, set out for the mountain', 'As she had been accustomed to riding from her childhood, she managedto travel as many miles daily as her brothers had done, and it was,as before, on the twentieth day that she arrived at the placewhere the dervish was sitting', '\"Good dervish,\" she said politely,\"will you allow me to rest by you for a few moments, and perhaps youwill be so kind as to tell me if you have ever heard of a Talking Bird,a Singing Tree, and some Golden Water that are to be found somewherenear this', '\"\"Madam,\" replied the dervish, \"for in spite of your manly dress yourvoice betrays you, I shall be proud to serve you in any way I can', 'But may I ask the purpose of your question', '\"\"Good dervish,\" answered the princess, \"I have heard such glowingdescriptions of these three things, that I cannot rest till Ipossess them', '\"\"Madam,\" said the dervish, \"they are far more beautiful thanany description, but you seem ignorant of all the difficultiesthat stand in your way, or you would hardly have undertakensuch an adventure', 'Give it up, I pray you, and return home,and do not ask me to help you to a cruel death', '\"\"Holy father,\" answered the princess, \"I come from far, and I shouldbe in despair if I turned back without having attained my object', 'You have spoken of difficulties; tell me, I entreat you, what they are,so that I may know if I can overcome them, or see if they are beyondmy strength', '\"So the dervish repeated his tale, and dwelt more firmly than beforeon the clamour of the voices, the horrors of the black stones,which were once living men, and the difficulties of climbingthe mountain; and pointed out that the chief means of successwas never to look behind till you had the cage in your grasp', '\"As far as I can see,\" said the princess, \"the first thing is notto mind the tumult of the voices that follow you till you reachthe cage, and then never to look behind', 'As to this, I think Ihave enough self-control to look straight before me; but as it isquite possible that I might be frightened by the voices, as even theboldest men have been, I will stop up my ears with cotton, so that,let them make as much noise as they like, I shall hear nothing', '\"\"Madam,\" cried the dervish, \"out of all the number who have asked methe way to the mountain, you are the first who has ever suggestedsuch a means of escaping the danger', 'It is possible that youmay succeed, but all the same, the risk is great', '\"\"Good dervish,\" answered the princess, \"I feel in my heart that Ishall succeed, and it only remains for me to ask you the way I amto go', '\"Then the dervish said that it was useless to say more, and he gaveher the ball, which she flung before her', 'The first thing the princess did on arriving at the mountain wasto stop her ears with cotton, and then, making up her mind which wasthe best way to go, she began her ascent', 'In spite of the cotton,some echoes of the voices reached her ears, but not so as to trouble her', 'Indeed, though they grew louder and more insulting the higher she climbed,the princess only laughed, and said to herself that she certainlywould not let a few rough words stand between her and the goal', 'At last she perceived in the distance the cage and the bird,whose voice joined itself in tones of thunder to those of the rest: \"Return, return', 'never dare to come near me', '\"At the sight of the bird, the princess hastened her steps, and withoutvexing herself at the noise which by this time had grown deafening,she walked straight up to the cage, and seizing it, she said: \"Now, my bird, I have got you, and I shall take good care that youdo not escape', '\"  As she spoke she took the cotton from her ears,for it was needed no longer', '\"Brave lady,\" answered the bird, \"do not blame me for having joinedmy voice to those who did their best to preserve my freedom', 'Although confined in a cage, I was content with my lot, but if Imust become a slave, I could not wish for a nobler mistress thanone who has shown so much constancy, and from this moment I swearto serve you faithfully', 'Some day you will put me to the proof,for I know who you are better than you do yourself', 'Meanwhile, tell mewhat I can do, and I will obey you', '\"\"Bird,\" replied the princess, who was filled with a joy that seemedstrange to herself when she thought that the bird had cost her thelives of both her brothers', '\"bird, let me first thank you for yourgood will, and then let me ask you where the Golden Water is to be found', '\"The bird described the place, which was not far distant, and theprincess filled a small silver flask that she had brought with herfor the purpose', 'She then returned to the cage, and said:  \"Bird,there is still something else, where shall I find the Singing Tree', '\"\"Behind you, in that wood,\" replied the bird, and the princesswandered through the wood, till a sound of the sweetest voices toldher she had found what she sought', 'But the tree was tall and strong,and it was hopeless to think of uprooting it', '\"You need not do that,\" said the bird, when she had returnedto ask counsel', '\"Break off a twig, and plant it in your garden,and it will take root, and grow into a magnificent tree', '\"When the Princess Parizade held in her hands the three wonderspromised her by the old woman, she said to the bird:  \"All that isnot enough', 'It was owing to you that my brothers became black stones', 'I cannot tell them from the mass of others, but you must know,and point them out to me, I beg you, for I wish to carry them away', '\"For some reason that the princess could not guess these words seemedto displease the bird, and he did not answer', 'The princess waiteda moment, and then continued in severe tones, \"Have you forgottenthat you yourself said that you are my slave to do my bidding,and also that your life is in my power', '\"\"No, I have not forgotten,\" replied the bird, \"but what you ask isvery difficult', 'However, I will do my best', 'If you look round,\"he went on, \"you will see a pitcher standing near', 'Take it, and, as yougo down the mountain, scatter a little of the water it containsover every black stone and you will soon find your two brothers', '\"Princess Parizade took the pitcher, and, carrying with her besidesthe cage the twig and the flask, returned down the mountain side', 'At every black stone she stopped and sprinkled it with water,and as the water touched it the stone instantly became a man', 'When she suddenly saw her brothers before her her delight was mixedwith astonishment', '\"Why, what are you doing here', '\" she cried', '\"We have been asleep,\" they said', '\"Yes,\" returned the princess, \"but without me your sleep wouldprobably have lasted till the day of judgment', 'Have you forgottenthat you came here in search of the Talking Bird, the Singing Tree,and the Golden Water, and the black stones that were heapedup along the road', 'Look round and see if there is one left', 'These gentlemen, and yourselves, and all your horses were changedinto these stones, and I have delivered you by sprinkling you withthe water from this pitcher', 'As I could not return home without you,even though I had gained the prizes on which I had set my heart,I forced the Talking Bird to tell me how to break the spell', '\"On hearing these words Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz understoodall they owed their sister, and the knights who stood by declaredthemselves her slaves and ready to carry out her wishes', 'But the princess, while thanking them for their politeness,explained that she wished for no company but that of her brothers,and that the rest were free to go where they would', 'So saying the princess mounted her horse, and, declining to alloweven Prince Bahman to carry the cage with the Talking Bird,she entrusted him with the branch of the Singing Tree, while PrincePerviz took care of the flask containing the Golden Water', 'Then they rode away, followed by the knights and gentlemen,who begged to be permitted to escort them', 'It had been the intention of the party to stop and tell theiradventures to the dervish, but they found to their sorrow that hewas dead, whether from old age, or whether from the feelingthat his task was done, they never knew', 'As they continued their road their numbers grew daily smaller,for the knights turned off one by one to their own homes, and onlythe brothers and sister finally drew up at the gate of the palace', 'The princess carried the cage straight into the garden, and, as soonas the bird began to sing, nightingales, larks, thrushes, finches,and all sorts of other birds mingled their voices in chorus', 'The branch she planted in a corner near the house, and in a fewdays it had grown into a great tree', 'As for the Golden Water itwas poured into a great marble basin specially prepared for it,and it swelled and bubbled and then shot up into the air in a fountaintwenty feet high', 'The fame of these wonders soon spread abroad, and people camefrom far and near to see and admire', 'After a few days Prince Bahman and Prince Perviz fell back intotheir ordinary way of life, and passed most of their time hunting', 'One day it happened that the Sultan of Persia was also huntingin the same direction, and, not wishing to interfere with his sport,the young men, on hearing the noise of the hunt approaching,prepared to retire, but, as luck would have it, they turnedinto the very path down which the Sultan was coming', 'They threwthemselves from their horses and prostrated themselves to the earth,but the Sultan was curious to see their faces, and commanded themto rise', 'The princes stood up respectfully, but quite at their ease,and the Sultan looked at them for a few moments without speaking,then he asked who they were and where they lived', '\"Sire,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"we are sons of your Highness\\'slate intendant of the gardens, and we live in a house that hebuilt a short time before his death, waiting till an occasionshould offer itself to serve your Highness', '\"\"You seem fond of hunting,\" answered the Sultan', '\"Sire,\" replied Prince Bahman, \"it is our usual exercise,and one that should be neglected by no man who expects to complywith the ancient customs of the kingdom and bear arms', '\"The Sultan was delighted with this remark, and said at once,\"In that case I shall take great pleasure in watching you', 'Come, choose what sort of beasts you would like to hunt', '\"The princes jumped on their horses and followed the Sultanat a little distance', 'They had not gone very far before theysaw a number of wild animals appear at once, and Prince Bahmanstarted to give chase to a lion and Prince Perviz to a bear', 'Both used their javelins with such skill that, directly they arrivedwithin striking range, the lion and the bear fell, pierced throughand through', 'Then Prince Perviz pursued a lion and PrinceBahman a bear, and in a very few minutes they, too, lay dead', 'As they were making ready for a third assault the Sultan interfered,and, sending one of his officials to summon them, he said smiling,\"If I let you go on, there will soon be no beasts left to hunt', 'Besides, your courage and manners have so won my heart that I willnot have you expose yourselves to further danger', 'I am convincedthat some day or other I shall find you useful as well a agreeable', '\"He then gave them a warm invitation to stay with him altogether,but with many thanks for the honour done them, they begged tobe excused, and to be suffered to remain at home', 'The Sultan who was not accustomed to see his offers rejectedinquired their reasons, and Prince Bahman explained that they didnot wish to leave their sister, and were accustomed to do nothingwithout consulting all three together', '\"Ask her advice, then,\" replied the Sultan, \"and to-morrow comeand hunt with me, and give me your answer', '\"The two princes returned home, but their adventure made so littleimpression on them that they quite forgot to speak to their sisteron the subject', 'The next morning when they went to hunt they metthe Sultan in the same place, and he inquired what advice theirsister had given', 'The young men looked at each other and blushed', 'At last Prince Bahman said, \"Sire, we must throw ourselves on yourHighness\\'s mercy', 'Neither my brother nor myself remembered anythingabout it', '\"\"Then be sure you do not forget to-day,\" answered the Sultan,\"and bring me back your reply to-morrow', '\"When, however, the same thing happened a second time, they fearedthat the Sultan might be angry with them for their carelessness', 'But he took it in good part, and, drawing three little goldenballs from his purse, he held them out to Prince Bahman, saying,\"Put these in your bosom and you will not forget a third time,for when you remove your girdle to-night the noise they will makein falling will remind you of my wishes', '\"It all happened as the Sultan had foreseen, and the two brothersappeared in their sister\\'s apartments just as she was in the actof stepping into bed, and told their tale', 'The Princess Parizade was much disturbed at the news, and did notconceal her feelings', '\"Your meeting with the Sultan is very honourableto you,\" she said, \"and will, I dare say, be of service to you,but it places me in a very awkward position', \"It is on my account,I know, that you have resisted the Sultan's wishes, and I amvery grateful to you for it\", 'But kings do not like to have theiroffers refused, and in time he would bear a grudge against you,which would render me very unhappy', 'Consult the Talking Bird,who is wise and far-seeing, and let me hear what he says', '\"So the bird was sent for and the case laid before him', '\"The princes must on no account refuse the Sultan\\'s proposal,\"said he, \"and they must even invite him to come and see your house', '\"\"But, bird,\" objected the princess, \"you know how dearly we loveeach other; will not all this spoil our friendship', '\"\"Not at all,\" replied the bird, \"it will make it all the closer', '\"\"Then the Sultan will have to see me,\" said the princess', 'The bird answered that it was necessary that he should see her,and everything would turn out for the best', \"The following morning, when the Sultan inquired if they had spokento their sister and what advice she had given them, Prince Bahmanreplied that they were ready to agree to his Highness's wishes,and that their sister had reproved them for their hesitation aboutthe matter\", 'The Sultan received their excuses with great kindness,and told them that he was sure they would be equally faithful to him,and kept them by his side for the rest of the day, to the vexationof the grand-vizir and the rest of the court', 'When the procession entered in this order the gates of the capital,the eyes of the people who crowded the streets were fixed on the twoyoung men, strangers to every one', '\"Oh, if only the Sultan had had sons like that', '\" they murmured,\"they look so distinguished and are about the same age that his sonswould have been', '\"The Sultan commanded that splendid apartments should be prepared for thetwo brothers, and even insisted that they should sit at table with him', 'During dinner he led the conversation to various scientific subjects,and also to history, of which he was especially fond, but whatevertopic they might be discussing he found that the views of the youngmen were always worth listening to', '\"If they were my own sons,\"he said to himself, \"they could not be better educated', '\" and aloudhe complimented them on their learning and taste for knowledge', 'At the end of the evening the princes once more prostrated themselvesbefore the throne and asked leave to return home; and then,encouraged by the gracious words of farewell uttered by the Sultan,Prince Bahman said:  \"Sire, may we dare to take the liberty of askingwhether you would do us and our sister the honour of resting fora few minutes at our house the first time the hunt passes that way', '\"\"With the utmost pleasure,\" replied the Sultan; \"and as I amall impatience to see the sister of such accomplished young menyou may expect me the day after to-morrow', '\"The princess was of course most anxious to entertain the Sultanin a fitting way, but as she had no experience in court customsshe ran to the Talking Bird, and begged he would advise heras to what dishes should be served', '\"My dear mistress,\" replied the bird, \"your cooks are very goodand you can safely leave all to them, except that you must becareful to have a dish of cucumbers, stuffed with pearl sauce,served with the first course', '\"\"Cucumbers stuffed with pearls', '\" exclaimed the princess', '\"Why, bird,who ever heard of such a dish', 'The Sultan will expect a dinner hecan eat, and not one he can only admire', 'Besides, if I were to useall the pearls I possess, they would not be half enough', '\"\"Mistress,\" replied the bird, \"do what I tell you and nothingbut good will come of it', 'And as to the pearls, if you go at dawnto-morrow and dig at the foot of the first tree in the park,on the right hand, you will find as many as you want', '\"The princess had faith in the bird, who generally proved to be right,and taking the gardener with her early next morning followed outhis directions carefully', 'After digging for some time they cameupon a golden box fastened with little clasps', 'These were easily undone, and the box was found to be full of pearls,not very large ones, but well-shaped and of a good colour', 'So leaving the gardener to fill up the hole he had made under the tree,the princess took up the box and returned to the house', 'The two princes had seen her go out, and had wondered what could havemade her rise so early', 'Full of curiosity they got up and dressed,and met their sister as she was returning with the box under her arm', '\"What have you been doing', '\" they asked, \"and did the gardener cometo tell you he had found a treasure', '\"\"On the contrary,\" replied the princess, \"it is I who have found one,\"and opening the box she showed her astonished brothers thepearls inside', 'Then, on the way back to the palace, she told themof her consultation with the bird, and the advice it had given her', 'All three tried to guess the meaning of the singular counsel,but they were forced at last to admit the explanation was beyond them,and they must be content blindly to obey', 'The first thing the princess did on entering the palace was to sendfor the head cook and to order the repast for the Sultan When shehad finished she suddenly added, \"Besides the dishes I have mentionedthere is one that you must prepare expressly for the Sultan, and thatno one must touch but yourself', 'It consists of a stuffed cucumber,and the stuffing is to be made of these pearls', '\"The head cook, who had never in all his experience heard of sucha dish, stepped back in amazement', '\"You think I am mad,\" answered the princess, who perceived what wasin his mind', '\"But I know quite well what I am doing', 'Go, and doyour best, and take the pearls with you', '\"The next morning the princes started for the forest, and were soonjoined by the Sultan', 'The hunt began and continued till mid-day,when the heat became so great that they were obliged to leave off', \"Then, as arranged, they turned their horses' heads towards the palace,and while Prince Bahman remained by the side of the Sultan,Prince Perviz rode on to warn his sister of their approach\", 'The moment his Highness entered the courtyard, the princess flungherself at his feet, but he bent and raised her, and gazed at herfor some time, struck with her grace and beauty, and also with theindefinable air of courts that seemed to hang round this country girl', '\"They are all worthy one of the other,\" he said to himself,\"and I am not surprised that they think so much of her opinions', 'I must know more of them', '\"By this time the princess had recovered from the first embarrassmentof meeting, and proceeded to make her speech of welcome', '\"This is only a simple country house, sire,\" she said,\"suitable to people like ourselves, who live a quiet life', \"It cannot compare with the great city mansions, much less,of course, with the smallest of the Sultan's palaces\", '\"\"I cannot quite agree with you,\" he replied; \"even the littlethat I have seen I admire greatly, and I will reserve my judgmentuntil you have shown me the whole', '\"The princess then led the way from room to room, and the Sultan examinedeverything carefully', '\"Do you call this a simple country house', '\"he said at last', '\"Why, if every country house was like this,the towns would soon be deserted', 'I am no longer astonishedthat you do not wish to leave it', 'Let us go into the gardens,which I am sure are no less beautiful than the rooms', '\"A small door opened straight into the garden, and the first objectthat met the Sultan\\'s eyes was the Golden Water', '\"What lovely coloured water', '\" he exclaimed; \"where is the spring,and how do you make the fountain rise so high', 'I do not believe thereis anything like it in the world', '\"  He went forward to examine it,and when he had satisfied his curiosity, the princess conducted himtowards the Singing Tree', 'As they drew near, the Sultan was startled by the sound ofstrange voices, but could see nothing', '\"Where have you hiddenyour musicians', '\" he asked the princess; \"are they up in the air,or under the earth', 'Surely the owners of such charming voicesought not to conceal themselves', '\"\"Sire,\" answered the princess, \"the voices all come from the treewhich is straight in front of us; and if you will deign to advancea few steps, you will see that they become clearer', '\"The Sultan did as he was told, and was so wrapt in delightat what he heard that he stood some time in silence', '\"Tell me, madam, I pray you,\" he said at last, \"how thismarvellous tree came into your garden', 'It must have been broughtfrom a great distance, or else, fond as I am of all curiosities,I could not have missed hearing of it', 'What is its name', '\"\"The only name it has, sire,\" replied she, \"is the Singing Tree,and it is not a native of this country', 'Its history is mixed up withthose of the Golden Water and the Talking Bird, which you have notyet seen', 'If your Highness wishes I will tell you the whole story,when you have recovered from your fatigue', '\"\"Indeed, madam,\" returned he, \"you show me so many wonders that itis impossible to feel any fatigue', 'Let us go once more and lookat the Golden Water; and I am dying to see the Talking Bird', '\"The Sultan could hardly tear himself away from the Golden Water,which puzzled him more and more', '\"You say,\" he observed tothe princess, \"that this water does not come from any spring,neither is brought by pipes', 'All I understand is, that neitherit nor the Singing Tree is a native of this country', '\"\"It is as you say, sire,\" answered the princess, \"and if youexamine the basin, you will see that it is all in one piece,and therefore the water could not have been brought through it', 'What is more astonishing is, that I only emptied a small flaskfulinto the basin, and it increased to the quantity you now see', '\"\"Well, I will look at it no more to-day,\" said the Sultan', '\"Take me to the Talking Bird', '\"On approaching the house, the Sultan noticed a vast quantity of birds,whose voices filled the air, and he inquired why they were so muchmore numerous here than in any other part of the garden', '\"Sire,\" answered the princess, \"do you see that cage hanging in oneof the windows of the saloon', 'that is the Talking Bird, whose voiceyou can hear above them all, even above that of the nightingale', 'And the birds crowd to this spot, to add their songs to his', '\"The Sultan stepped through the window, but the bird took no notice,continuing his song as before', '\"My slave,\" said the princess, \"this is the Sultan; make hima pretty speech', '\"The bird stopped singing at once, and all the other birds stopped too', '\"The Sultan is welcome,\" he said', '\"I wish him long lifeand all prosperity', '\"\"I thank you, good bird,\" answered the Sultan, seating himselfbefore the repast, which was spread at a table near the window,\"and I am enchanted to see in you the Sultan and King of the Birds', '\"The Sultan, noticing that his favourite dish of cucumber was placedbefore him, proceeded to help himself to it, and was amazed to andthat the stuffing was of pearls', '\"A novelty, indeed', '\" cried he,\"but I do not understand the reason of it; one cannot eat pearls', '\"\"Sire,\" replied the bird, before either the princes or the princesscould speak, \"surely your Highness cannot be so surprised at beholdinga cucumber stuffed with pearls, when you believed without anydifficulty that the Sultana had presented you, instead of children,with a dog, a cat, and a log of wood', '\"\"I believed it,\" answered the Sultan, \"because the women attendingon her told me so', '\"\"The women, sire,\" said the bird, \"were the sisters of the Sultana,who were devoured with jealousy at the honour you had done her, and inorder to revenge themselves invented this story', 'Have them examined,and they will confess their crime', 'These are your children,who were saved from death by the intendant of your gardens,and brought up by him as if they were his own', '\"Like a flash the truth came to the mind of the Sultan', '\"Bird,\" he cried, \"my heart tells me that what you say is true', 'My children,\" he added, \"let me embrace you, and embrace each other,not only as brothers and sister, but as having in you the bloodroyal of Persia which could flow in no nobler veins', '\"When the first moments of emotion were over, the Sultan hastenedto finish his repast, and then turning to his children he exclaimed: \"To-day you have made acquaintance with your father', 'To-morrow Iwill bring you the Sultana your mother', 'Be ready to receive her', '\"The Sultan then mounted his horse and rode quickly back to the capital', \"Without an instant's delay he sent for the grand-vizir, and orderedhim to seize and question the Sultana's sisters that very day\", 'This was done', 'They were confronted with each other and proved guilty,and were executed in less than an hour', 'But the Sultan did not wait to hear that his orders had beencarried out before going on foot, followed by his whole court tothe door of the great mosque, and drawing the Sultana with his ownhand out of the narrow prison where she had spent so many years,\"Madam,\" he cried, embracing her with tears in his eyes,\"I have come to ask your pardon for the injustice I have done you,and to repair it as far as I may', 'I have already begun by punishingthe authors of this abominable crime, and I hope you will forgiveme when I introduce you to our children, who are the most charmingand accomplished creatures in the whole world', 'Come with me,and take back your position and all the honour that is due to you', '\"This speech was delivered in the presence of a vast multitude of
